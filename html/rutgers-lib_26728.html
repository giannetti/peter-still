      Peter Stills (a co<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">h</span>loured man), has lived in my employ for some months past, but have
      known him for two years.
      
      
       It affords me much pleasure in being able to [recommend] him, as an honest sober, industrious &amp; capable man, perfectly
      trustworthy &amp; ever willing to make himself generally
      [useful] either about the house or stable, I part with him reluctantly, he
      leaves me, to make an effort to redeem his wife &amp; children from slavery

       The above named Peter Still was in my employ ten months, during
      which time he fully sustained the character given him by M<sup>r</sup> Boudinot. It gives me pleasure to add my name to this
      recommmendation.
