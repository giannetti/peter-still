      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Uncle Peter</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Book is at last out</span>. I saw Mr. Hamilton on Saturday. He
         had received a few copies by Express, though it is not advertised for sale until
         the <span style="font-style: italic;">5th[?]</span> June. It looks very well -
         the paper is nice and the type clear - indeed the whole looks inviting and
         interesting. The head of your mother is excellent. If they had only copied the
         other daguerreotypes as well they would have looked very natural.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Mr Hamilton requested me to write you immediately to ask you to
         come right on and take an agency to sell the book. He thinks you could sell more
         than any other one man, and the profit you would make would pay you well. His
         plan is to have you visit the same places which you visited while collecting
         money. Few that aided you, even if they gave you but a trifle, would refuse to
         buy a book if you presented it.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> The Book contains 409 pages, and is to sell at $1,25. Mr. May's
         Introduction is  very beautiful. I think all your friends will like it very
         much.
         
      </p>
      
      <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br />
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Would you like my advice about going out to sell the books? I
         think if your family can get along comfortably without you it will be the best
         thing you can do to take the agency as proposed by Mr. Hamilton. He will give
         you the same profit that he does to other agents, and you know, the more copies
         are sold, the more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">our ten per cent</span> will amount to.
         There is so much excitement at present about Slavery, that many of our friends are
         glad the publication of the book has been delayed till just this time. I have
         many things to tell you about it, but I hope to see you soon, so I will leave
         them.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Please write immediately to let us know whether or not to
         expect you. The quicker you come on, the better it will be for the book. Be sure
         to write as soon as you get this, &amp;  if you decide to take the agency, come on.
         Come here first, and I will go with you to Syracuse to
         see Mr. Hamilton.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Much love to Aunt Vina
         &amp; your children. I am glad to hear that they are all doing well.
         
      </p>
