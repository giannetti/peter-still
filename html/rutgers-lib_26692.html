      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Uncle Peter.</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I was glad to receive your letter of the 1<sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;">st</span></sup> and to learn
         from it that you are well and your family well provided for.

       This afternoon Mrs Reynolds came to see me. I read your
      letter to her. She told me that she had no doubt her daughter Mrs. Pickard would undertake to write the
      Memoir of your life.
      
      
       The life of Seth Conklin should be
      embodied in it, or published in the Appendix. -- I supposed that D<sup>r </sup> 
      Furness intended to complete the sketch he has
      so well commenced and publish it with his own name upon
      <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> it, which would attract still more the the
      public attention. I hope he will do so. It now seems to me that the work
      should be entitled this "Memoirs of the Life of Peter Still, forty two
      years a Slave; of his remarkable restoration to liberty, and to his aged
      mother and her children; together with the subsequent liberation of his
      family. By Mrs. Emily Pickard; to which is added a sketch of the life of Seth
      Conklin, who was sacrificed himself in an attempt to
      deliver the family of Mr Still by Rev W<sup>m</sup> H. Furness
      DD."
      
      
       This will intimate to you what I think the book should be and something
      like the above should be its title.

       Whenever you please to come on, Mrs. Pickard will be happy to make the
      necessary arrangements with you. But before you come, you had better see
      D<sup>r</sup>. Furness and learn from him what he prefers to
      do or have done in the matter. His memoir of Seth Conklin is exceedingly
      interesting.
      
      
       We shall be very glad to see you, and your wife and your children. But  if they have got good places, it
      wouldn't be wise to get them off, and take them from place to place - exhibiting
      them to your friends and the public. That would get them into unsettled,
      unthrifty habits.
      
      
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;"> -- Your sincere friend,</p>
      <p style="padding-left:13em; text-indent:-2em;">Sam. J. May.</p>
