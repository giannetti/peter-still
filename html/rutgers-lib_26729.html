      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Mr May</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         You can scarcely imagine my delight 
         at greeting once more my good friend Peter
         and under circumstances so unlike those which 
         attended my first acquaintance with him.
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         When I first entered the Tuscumbia Fem.
         Seminary as a teacher – Jan. 15 1847 – there 
         was Peter –  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a slave</span>! Morning, noon, and 
         night found him there. For a year I met 
         him every day, and every day saw more cause 
         to admire his character. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         I did not then know that he panted for freedom, 
         the fact that he was saving every penny to 
         "buy himself" was a secret. I knew that he 
         worked hard, that he bought no fine clothes 
         though his  garments were always scrupulously 
         clean. I knew at one time of his having 
         $10 in 5 cent pieces changed for gold, and 
         that all these little earnings were carefully 
         hoarded. but if I had guessed the object of his 
         industry and economy, I should have deemed 
         it wisest most prudent to ask no questions 
         and to make no remarks. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Peter at that time belonged to the Gist 
         estate, to an heir of which Mrs. John Hogun 
         
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> 
         he was apportioned. The Gist and Hogun 
         families lived on plantations in the neighborhood 
         of Tuscumbia, and Peter had been for several 
         years hired out in town. He could do all 
         kinds of work – in the house, the stable, or the 
         field – and his capability and integrity were so 
         well known to the citizens generally that he was 
         trusted everywhere.
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         I left the Tuscumbia Seminary at the 
         end of a year, but remained in the vicinity 
         until April 1850. During this time I visited 
         Tuscumbia frequently, and always met Peter 
         there. Mr. Sloan (formerly of Syracuse you  
         will recollect) could hardly do without him 
         at the school rooms. He was so punctual, and 
         so orderly, so kind and respectful to the pupils, 
         that no one could quite fill his place. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Besides his work at the Seminary, he 
         waited on Mr. Friedman by whom he was hired, 
         blacked his boots, swept his room, &amp;c. &amp;c. waited 
         on the table at the hotel to pay his board, 
         and did all sorts of odd jobs for any one in 
         town who happened to need his services. He 
         had always plenty to do, and always did it well.
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> 
         And now he is free! After forty 
         years of toil, he at length possesses a deed of himself 
         – <span style="text-decoration: underline;">conferring the right to be a man</span> instead of a 
         chattel. And he has found his mother!
         
      </p>
      <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br />
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         How eloquent is his simple story! Who can 
         listen to it with unmoistened eyes?
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         But his poor wife and their three children are 
         still slaves and the only way that seems open for 
         their exit from the land of bondage is through 
         the gate of money.
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Some conscientious persons object to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">paying</span> the 
         man-stealer for his prey, but poor Peter's 
         anxious heart cannot by such scruples be 
         quieted. He longs for the presence of those 
         so dear to him – and they – how do their hearts 
         yearn for the society of husband and father! 
         When at night they stretch themselves upon their 
         rude pallets in their lowly cabin, and when the 
         dawn of morning calls them to their weary 
         tasks, do they not pray for deliverance? 
         O let us save them if we can! The giver shall 
         be blessed, and Maj. McKiernan, the owner of 
         their bodies will be little benefited, even though  
         he should receive the whole of his exhorbitant 
         demand.
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         I think however that if some generous 
         neighbor of Maj. McKiernan can be induced to 
         lend his aid, that price may be abated. They 
         could not, I should think be valued, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> according
            to market prices</span>, higher than $3000. It 
         would at least, be well to make the effort.
         I have a friend there, an honest and influential
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 4]</small></p><br />
         man, who may I think be persuaded 
         to exert himself in his behalf I will try.
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Peter's cause commends itself to every 
         human heart – and <span style="font-style: italic;">O[?]</span> if human hearts 
         will but overcome the dictates of cold selfishness, 
         how soon will his anxious suspense 
         be ended! May the Friend of the Poor speedily 
         reward his patience by the realization of his 
         fondest hopes!
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         I hope Sir, to see you when I go to 
         Syracuse, which will probably be before 
         many days, and to learn of the success of 
         your efforts. We will do all we can for him 
         in Camillus.
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">Yours very truly</p>
      <p style="padding-left:13em; text-indent:-2em;">Kate E. R. Pickard</p>
