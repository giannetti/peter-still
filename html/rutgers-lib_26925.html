      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> L. W. Hall &amp; Co of Syracuse propose
         to publish the Narrative as follows -
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Mr Hall will take all the responsibilities and risks of
         publishing the work, and will pay to the proprietors two fifths of all the 
         profits - He would be willing to divide the 
         <span style="text-decoration: underline;">profits &amp; risks</span> equally, but in case of fire or bad debts
         that 
         <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">would </span>
         might
          lay a heavy burden on Peter &amp; myself. Mr May advises to let him
         take <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> the risks involved.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Mr Hall will issue 5000 at first and at his lowest estimate the
         profits on that issue will be 
         <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">$2500</span>
         $1250
         . That, if we accept the proposition, will according to the terms
         settled between Peter &amp; myself - give
         us $250 apiece. The next issue will cost much less
         as the plates will be prepared &amp;c ... the profits consequently, will be
         proportionally greater.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Mr. May has ere this
         written to Mr Jewett of Boston on the subject, and by the
         21st
         inst I am to give Mr Hall a definite answer with regard to
         accepting his terms. Mr May will meantime gain all the information essential to
         a safe decision.
