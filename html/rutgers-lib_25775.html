       Last Friday afternoon, Peter
      Freedman was brought to this office by a man whom I was [partially] acquainted with,
      <sup>the</sup> object of Peter was to see if he could gain
      some instruction how he might find his parents &amp; relatives, [whom] he had been sold away from for 43 years. The remarks made by
      the stranger much surprised me and I soon began to make [inquiry] as to his parents and their names, He <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">an</span> immediately gave the names of his father,
      mother, and the brother who was also sold with him at the same time.
      By this time I perceived that a wonderful development was about to be
      made. My feelings became <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">unt</span>
      unutterable, although I endeavored to [suppress] them with much effort, but the fact that this Peter was one
      of my long absent brothers stared me too full in the face to
      gainsay or dispute the evidence for one moment. Thus a brother whom
      <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br /> whom I had never before seen was
      introduced to me in this most wonderful manner. It would afford me
      much pleasure to make fuller statement concerning this matter but for
      want of time I must [forbear] at present Suffice it to say that Peter found his mother, 5
      brothers &amp; 3 sisters situated [comfortably] in life
