      The bearer, Peter Still, has
      been above forty years in
      slavery. He is an honest
      and good man. His
      letters are perfectly satisfactory.
      Peter's simple narrative has
      not the dark and dismal
      shades of Uncle Tom's
      but it is truthful and deeply
      interesting. If [anyone] wishes
      to weep or to make others
      weep, "they have but to learn
      his story, and that would
      do it."
