      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">My Dear Peter:</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> We would be glad to hear what you are doing towards
         effecting the deliverance of your family. I understood that you had written to
         [McKiernan], to know of him, if he would not take three thousand
         Dols. for your family - if so, have you received any answer yet? O
         how glad I should be to hear <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">of</span> that <sup>the</sup> price on your family had been reduced, say two
         thousand Dols. But I have but little hope of being gratified with
         such news.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Have you ascertained yet what your friends in
         Burlington &amp; N.J. will do in the
         way of pecuniary means, providing you can buy <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">them</span> your family? I
         should like to come up some time before long and have an interview with
         some of the friends on the subject.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Mr. M<sup>c</sup>Kim rec'd a
         letter last Saturday from Rev. S. J May, of
         Syracuse in which was a note from Mrs. Reynolds, which I will enclose to you. probably
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> you can understand it. I cannot.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> My love to Mary &amp; tell
         her she must go up to Mother's soon
         &amp; give Sophia a [setting] back. James informed me, in a
         letter last Saturday, that Sophia had been giving some great insults to Mother;
         and he proposed <sup>to</sup> go<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">ing</span> up some
         time this week. Poor fellow, he was trembling. He thought if you would only lay
         claim to your share of the property it would <sup>have</sup> a
         good attendency. I answered his letter yesterday, &amp; advised him to go up &amp;
         read the law to them in plain language. So that they may know exactly just
         what to defend upon. But I want Mary to go up just for Sophia's sake. Tell
         her I will pay her fare providing she will go, she need not [lose] any time. She can leave Burlington on Saturday
         Morning &amp; then return on Monday Morning â€“ by all means preva<sup>i</sup>l on her to go.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> My wife &amp;
         Daughter are both well, &amp; though
         they know nothing of my being in the act of writing this letter yet I will take
         the liberty to send their love to you.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Answer this letter soon &amp; oblige
