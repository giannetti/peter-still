         The bearer Peter Still who is a native of New Jersey, if not of near kin to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">us</span>, has been presented to me by very respectable parties, with the assurance that his
         statements can be relied on - he arrived here three days since <sup>from Burlington NJ.</sup> &amp; is waiting the arrival of his wife &amp; three children who <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have been purchased</span> from slavery in Alabama by the aid of kind friends, for the enormous sum of $5000 - and he now asks from his Jersey relatives &amp; others only a sufficient amount to
         purchase some necessary clothing &amp; pay their expenses to Burlington New Jersey - (from
         the vicinity of which, tis said, he was stolen when abt 6 yrs old &amp; carried to Ky and sold - having purchased his own freedom some 4 yrs since.)
         
      </p>
      permit me to commend him to your favourable notice <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at his special request</span>.
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">I am very [respectfully]</p>
