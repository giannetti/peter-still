      <p style="text-align: left;">My Dear Bro.</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         I have received, this evening,
         through the Rev. Samuel J. May of Syracuse,
         a letter from you, informing me of your 
         whereabouts etc. I was very glad to hear from
         you especially as I had heard nothing
         from your since you started out, on your Mission.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         You [were] fortunate in falling into
         the hands of the Rev. S. J. May. He is a true
         friend of the bondman, and will no doubt
         be of great service to you.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         I often think about you, and most
         ardently hope you will succeed in rescuing
         your wife &amp; children from the hands of the 
         tyrant who now holds them. But the price  
         demanded to redeem them, is so monstrously 
         unrighteous. I must confess to you, that I am 
         some times led almost to despair in reference
         to your accomplishing the object [sought]. 
         But you must not be discouraged - persevere
         hope on, and the difficulties may yet all be 
         overcome.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         As I never told you definitively 
         
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br />
         
         how much money I have thought might be 
         raised in Philadelphia, I will do so now.
         My <span style="text-decoration: underline;">private</span> opinion is, that $1000 may be
         raised providing your efforts in N.J. and 
         the East shall prove [encouraging]. I hold
         myself ready for $50 out of my own little purse.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Enclosed you will find Mr. [McKiernan's]
         letter. As to Seth Conklin's letters, 
         the Rev. W. H. Furness, [has] them in his
         possession at this time. He is now writing
         out some of Mr. Conklin's most indescribably thrilling
         adventures &amp;c.; however I shall probably see him
         in the course of <sup>a</sup> day or two and I will get
         the one you sent for &amp; mail it to you.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Please write to me soon &amp; let
         me hear how you have succeeded 
         and what your hopes and prospects are.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Our Anti Slavery Fair closed last
         evening, consequently [today] finds me
         very busy, so you must excuse me for 
         not writing more at length.

         heard from them which was recently.
