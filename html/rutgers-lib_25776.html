      <p style="text-align: left;">
         [Dear] Sir, 
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Your letter has remained unanswered, for so long,
         because I have not been able to have an interview with Mr. McKiernan on the
         subject about which you wrote. I have just seen him. He says he will not
         separate the family of negroes and that the lowest price he will take
         under any circumstances  is $5,000 and
         if that [amount] is placed  in my hands or with any responsible persons for
         him, he will let the negroes go. I would like if Peter could get his wife &amp; family. I think this [amount] a high price,  but it is the lowest I know.
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">Very [Respectfully]
         
      </p>
