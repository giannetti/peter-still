         [January]

      <p style="text-align: left;">My dear [Brother]</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> The bearer Peter 
         [Still] is one of God[']s own poor from the  land
         of bondage who having bought  his own body, is now endeavouring  to raise money
         to purchase his wife
          &amp; children. I know, you &amp; other  friends of a Common Redeemer 
         &amp; of a common humanity will do  what is needful to accomplish an  object so
         dear to the heart of this  child of God. Unless the owner
          of his family like some other fiends  in human shape refuse to part with 
         them, so soon as he finds that the  funds are secured, I think
         Peter
          will one day call his wife his &amp;
          children his own. Mrs. Hoyt says 
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br />
         ["]tell Mr Williston that [though] the 
         <span style="font-style: italic;">[?]</span> have <span style="font-style: italic;">burned
            of[?]</span> his  house, I know that they have  not <span style="font-style: italic;">burned[?]</span>
         out the goodness  of his heart." May God 
          second the efforts of this hitherto 
         <span style="font-style: italic;">oppressed[?]</span> one to <span style="font-style: italic;">compass[?]</span> the objects  so dear
         to his heart 
      </p>
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;"> Very truly yours </p>
