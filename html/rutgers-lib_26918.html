      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Uncle Peter</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Your brother William called
         on Mr May a few days since on his way to
         Canada. When he returns he is to spend
         a few hours with me, and I would very much
         like to have you here at that time. I do
         not know how soon he will return - Mr
         May thought he would come some time
         next week.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Nothing is yet decided about the publisher -
         we had thought best to put it
         into the hands of Mr Hall of Syracuse,
         but two or three weeks since he changed
         his mind about wishing to publish it. He
         thinks he shall go out of the Book business
         <sup>soon</sup> and remove to New York City; and if
         he does so, it would not of course be best
         for him to undertake this.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Since we learned Mr. Hall's decision
         we have written to Mr Jewett of Boston
         &amp; to a Firm in New York; both of whom
         wish to see the manuscript. It will
         therefore be necessary to send to them that
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br />
         part of it which is already finished,
         and we think best for you to come on
         now &amp; hear it read.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         The part of it which relates to your
         personal history is done. What remains
         to be written is the account of the running
         away, and of your tour through the North,
         the <sup>facts</sup><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">most</span> of which <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">will</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">relate to</span> are all
         in my possession.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         There is a little matter, though of considerable
         importance, about which I wish to 
         talk to you [before] I go any further. So
         come on as soon as you can.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         We want to get the book out before
         the Holidays, and in order to do that, no
         time must be lost.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Much love to Aunt Vina. I hope
         she is well and happy.
         
      </p>

      when I may expect you.
