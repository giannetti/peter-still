      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Sir</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">few days ago</span> I received a letter from
         my friend William Lloyd Garrison, of
         Boston enclosing a request signed by 
         Peter Still - his mark - that I would send
         to you two hundred dollars that interesting
         man left in my hand, being money which he had collected towards the sum
         demanded for the liberty of his wife and children. Please find enclosed a draft
         <sup>for $200</sup> on 
         New York, made payable to your order - and I will thank
         you to acknowledge the receipt of it. -- 
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">Please give my kindest regards to Peter Still and assure
         him that I shall hold myself in readiness at any time to 
         [fulfill] my written promise to him -- 
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> And moreover let him know
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br /> that I have some hope of getting the price
         demanded for the family reduced somewhat - perhaps to $4000 - I cannot promise
         that it will be done - but Providence has unexpectedly offered a door for
         some approach to the slaveholderâ€™s heart -- 
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">Yours Respectfully</p>
      <p style="padding-left:13em; text-indent:-2em;">Samuel J. May</p>
