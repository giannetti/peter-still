      <p style="text-align: right;"> Salem </p>
      <p style="text-align: right;">First month 12th. 1854</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">My Dear Friend <br />
         Robert <span style="font-style: italic;">I.[?]</span> Murray
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I take the liberty of  giving the bearer Peter Still a letter to thee. -
         He is  the colored man, whose story I partly related  to thee in
         Boston. - 
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I think there is that in his story that  verifies the
         proverb that "truth is stranger  than fiction." 
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I do not doubt the truthfulness of Peter  and he can
         tell thee his own story, which  unfolds a phase in the history of slavery
          strongly illustrative of its evils, it oppressions, its injustice and
         its opposition to all that is  good and kind and Christian. 
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I have ventured to tell Peter that I think  he will
         find sympathizing friends in New York
          and among them the kind friend I now address. 
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> My wife desires to be kindly remembered  to thee with
         love to thy wife. - We remember  with pleasure thy too short call upon us
         in  the autumn - Please remember me respectfully  to thy wife and
         believe me 
      </p>
