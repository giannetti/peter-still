      <p style="text-align: right;">April 7, 1872</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Mr. Still:</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I have already delayed too long in thanking you for your
         presentation to me of your voluminous and well-executed work, “The
         Underground Railroad.” I have examined it with a deep and thrilling interest. It
         is a most important portion of Anti-Slavery History, which but for your
         industry, research, and personal experience and knowledge, might nearly all have
         been lost to posterity. Its reliableness, moreover, cannot be called in
         question.  It is, therefore, not “fiction <span style="font-style: italic;">founded[?]</span> upon fact,”
         and embellished by a lively imagination, but fact without a particle of fiction,
         and narrated
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> in a simple, ingenuous, straightforward
         manner, and needing no coloring whatever. What a revelation it makes of the
         barbarities of the slave system - of the formidable obstacles which interposed
         to prevent a successful exodus from the house of bondage - of the terrible
         exposures and sufferings to which the fugitive slaves were subjected in their
         attempts to be free - of the daring and heroism required to run the risk of
         betrayal, recapture, starvation in the swamp and drowning in the river,
         suffocation in trunk or box, seizure by two-legged and four-legged bloodhounds
         in hot pursuit, and a thousand other perils! How it illustrates, too, the
         object subservience of the nation to the Slave Power, so that even in
         Boston the atrocious Fugitive
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br /> Slave Law was as effectually enforced as it
         could have been in New Orleans; and in all our broad
         domains none <sup>could</sup> give shelter or assistance to the
         hunted and famishing victim, except at the peril of <span style="font-style: italic;">fire[?]</span> and
         imprisonment! And yet, numerous as are the instances you have recorded, they are
         <sup>only</sup> samples of thousands of others which can never be
         chronicled, running through six generations. May we trust our senses that
         there is an end of all this wickedness --  that a final and marvelous
         deliverance has been wrought for all in bondage? Yes, it is true: and there has
         been the same divine interposition as of old. “And the Lord said, I have surely
         seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by
         reason of their
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 4]</small></p><br /> taskmasters; for I know their sorrows, and I
         am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians.” … “Thy right
         hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed
         in pieces the enemy!”
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I hope that the sale of your work will be widely extended,
         not only that the large expense incurred in its preparation and printing
         may be liberally covered, but for the enlightenment of the rising
         generations to the inherent cruelty of the defunct slave system, and to
         perpetuate such an abhorrence of it as to prevent all further injustice
         towards the colored population of our land. It is a book for every
         household.

      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">Yours, with best wishes,</p>
      <p style="padding-left:13em; text-indent:-2em;">W<sup>m</sup> Lloyd
         Garrison.
      </p>
