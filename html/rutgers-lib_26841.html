      The bearer, Peter Still, has
      deeply interested me by this
      simple and obviously truthful
      narrative which he gives 
      of his experience in slavery,
      and the wonderful series
      of providences which attended 
      him in finding his Mother
      and brothers and sisters after
      an absence of forty years. 
      
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         He is worthy of the fullest
         confidence, and will, I am 
         sure, meet with favor <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">with</span> from
         all who hear from him the 
         incidents of his affecting history.
         If any one wishes to shed 
         tears of gratitude and joy and
         sympathy he has but to hear
         Peter's story, "and that would
         do it."
