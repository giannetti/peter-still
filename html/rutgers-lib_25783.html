      <p style="text-align: right;">May 10/52</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">My Dear Peter:</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> in consequence of <sup>having</sup> being very
         busy for the last 3 weeks, I have not  had the [privilege], as I desired, to come  up to see you. I also might add that you 
         wrote me in your last that you designed  to come to this city about the first of May
          providing you [read] certain intelligence  from Cincinnati on the
         South. As you  have not come, I take it for granted  that you have failed to
         obtain the  desired information. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I hope you are well  and composed in mind. Could I  say or
         do any thing to render you  any <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">availability</span>
         <sup>aid</sup> or comfort, I would  most gladly do it - I suppose you [think] some times, that your new Bros &amp; sisters  do not interest
         themselves sufficiently  enough in your behalf: or, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">that</span> more would have been done, ere this, for the  Emancipation of your
         family, whom  you feel for so affectionately, so keenly -  But what can your
         Bros do? They feel <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">as</span> for you, &amp; especially for
         your poor family in 
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> in bo<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">u</span>nds - but
         under ca<sup>l</sup>m<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">l</span> deliberation 
         they cannot be insensible to the great  difficulties which intervene between 
         your family in the South, &amp; your Bros  in the North. But I will not add to 
         your feelings by continuing these remarks  further. but let me say trust in 
         God. [Commit] all your ways &amp; being into  his hands &amp; you may be assured that one
          day, sooner or [later], He has the power  and He will see that ample justice is  done you. I
         am aware my Dear Bro  that the idea of trusting in god is by  many [ridiculed], [whilst] many others use  it merely out of a hypocritical form;  but
         notwithstanding all that there is a  comfort &amp; peace to be found therein, which
          cannot be obtained through any other  source. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         My wife &amp; little Daughter are very well at present. I [read] a  letter from Bro. John a few
         days ago.  he had been sick, or unwell rather,  for about 4 weeks - but was [getting]
          better when he wrote. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I have not heard from 
         Mother &amp; the rest of our family 
         about Medford for several weeks. The  last
         letter I [read] from James, he informed 
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br /> me that they were all well as common.  And
         he had been buying the 
         Crossroads Tavern, at the cost of $19.75 I have been wanting to go to see them  but time
         with me is so precious  that I do not know when I shall get to  go. I hope soon,
         however. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Sister Mary was at our house 
         yesterday, she was well - She is going  to
         New York soon and probably will  go from thence to
         Canada.
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Sister Kitty &amp; her family  are all
         well. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">I shall come up as soon  as I can make it convenient. If 
         it is not too much trouble, please  write to me soon. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">Your Affectionate Bro.</p>
