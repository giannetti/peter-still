      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Sir.</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Through the [advice] of W<sup>m</sup>
         <span style="font-style: italic;">I.[?]</span> Bowditch, Esq. of Boston, I take
         the liberty of addressing you a few lines in relation to my Bro.  
         Peter.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I am exceedingly desirous to learn for the satisfaction of many
         of Peter's friends as well as may own, how he is succeeding in raising money:
         the amount he has collected; his propects, plans, etc., etc., would afford us
         much satisfaction to know something about them.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Please tell Peter to write to me at once, as it may be of much
         importance to him.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Rev. W<sup>m</sup> H. Furness has
         been kind enough to write out the Narrative of Seth
         Conklin whose life was sa<span style="text-decoration: underline;">crifi</span>ced in striving to
         secure the liberation of Peter's family. The narrative, of course, [embraces] the particulars connected with the escape &amp; capture of Peter's family
         – hence it will <em>not</em> do to publish it until P.'s family are
         redeemed. It is exceedingly thrilling &amp; interesting.
         Mr J. M. M<sup>c</sup>Kim
         embarks for England tomorrow, taking a mss. copy
         of the narrative
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> along with him where it is to be hoped he
         will be able to do much <sup>for</sup> P. by presenting his case
         &amp;c.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I will say, briefly, that we are now under the impression that
         P.'s family can be had for
         $3000 – instead of $5000 – as demanded by their inhuman owner. The plan is to get a
         man in the South to purchase them, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at</span> th<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ei</span>r o<span style="text-decoration: underline;">rdin</span>ary m<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ar</span>ket p<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ri</span>ce. In this hope we have been quite encour<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">r</span>aged, having already succeeded in finding a gentleman,
         in this City, who has an agent in the very County wherein P.'s family live. This
         gentleman (Mr. D. B. Bi<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">r</span>rney,
         son of James G. Birney) is very sanguine that the object can be
         very readily accomplished, and without any charge on his part, or his agent all
         <sup>that</sup> is needed is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> m<span style="text-decoration: underline;">on</span>ey, to pu<span style="text-decoration: underline;">rch</span>ase them.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Mr. Birney is connected with "Goodridge &amp; Co's Law, [Mercantile], and Collecting Agency's" office in this city; consequently we feel it to
         be almost <span style="text-decoration: underline;">p</span>rovidential that we come [across] him.
         
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Please do me the favour to write soon, as I am under an
         obligation to Mr. M Kim to send him any information that I may receive from you, [touching] my Bro. &amp;e.
