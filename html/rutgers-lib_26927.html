      <p style="text-align: left;">[Respected Friend]</p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I [received] a letter from Dillwyn Smith a few days ago saying he was likely to
          be <span style="font-style: italic;">fined[?]</span> by Lanmaster for the balance  of his bill
         which I regretted very much to  hear as I expected <span style="font-style: italic;">thee[?]</span> had
         furnished  ere this from the last conversation I had  with thee at
         Burlington just before thee  left for New
         England to sell Books  Notwithstanding the
         <span style="font-style: italic;">arbitration[?]</span> found if  necessary to reduce the bills for
         material  favor I come to house &amp;c. it does not altogether  release
         Dillwyn from the full payment of  some bills and still hold him liable. 
         Now if they will not make any deduction  Dillwyn will have paid or given thee
          more than any other person except thy  Brother James. Now this falls very  heavy on him at
         this time as he has  met with many losses and further  I want thee to take
         into consideration  that Dillwyn, family &amp; connections have  done more
         for thee than all others with  their money &amp; [recommendation], -
         <span style="font-style: italic;">Now[?]</span> I think  it justly done for thee to go forward at once
          and pay Lanmaster after getting him <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> to deduct from his bill any
         amount he  is missing, it is possible he may take  half <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">if so much better</span> Now Peter as a  friend I would
         advise thee to <span style="font-style: italic;">attend[?]</span> to the  above [tomorrow] morning without fail  as I should be very sorry for thee to 
         [lose] the interest of thy best friends and  injure the cause of freedom for
         the  slave - 
      </p>
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">From thy friend</p>

   N.B.  I forgot to mention about the painter Bill who is very urgent for
   payment  which I hope thee see to soon &amp;c  H. P. Ely
