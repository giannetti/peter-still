      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Uncle Peter</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> It is a very long time since I heard from you -- I hope you
         &amp; Aunt Vina have been comfortable in
         your own home <sup>through</sup> all the past cold winter. How glad you
         must have been to see the Spring!
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The book is almost ready</span>. Mr Pickard sa
         <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">y</span>
         w
          Mr. Hamilton, the publisher, yesterday. He said that he had the promise of
         having the book ready to issue on the 15th of this
         month. I think however it may possibly be delayed a few days longer. Mr.
         Hamilton has taken as partner in this business the Firm of Miller, Orton, &amp;
         Mulligan, of Auburn - one of the best publishing houses in the
         state. They published [Frederick Douglass]' book last year, and have published several other works on Slavery. I
         think the arrangement will be a great help to the circulation of the book. 
         <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You &amp; I must begin to plan what to do  with our money</span>. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Mr Hamilton showed me the proof of the pictures the last time I
         saw him.
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> They all suited me very well except the
         portraits of yourself and family - and they looked no more like you <sup>all</sup> than if they had been made entirely by guess. I sent
         your daguerreotypes to the Engraver, but somehow or other he blundered sadly.
         You never saw a meaner looking set of "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">darkies</span>" than he
         made you out to be. He had <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> seated in front with your head
         down, looking as though you had just taken a "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">cutting up</span>" &amp; expected soon to receive another. Aunt Vina
         they had standing before you - a big woman - about like our big Sally - looking
         no more like herself than she looks like me - except the color - and the
         children standing in the background looked no better. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I told Mr. Hamilton I should object to publishing such a thing
         as that for your family - it would be an insult to you &amp; to your friends. He
         thought so too - he had never seen you, he said, but from what he had heard of
         you, he thought you must be different looking people from
         <span style="font-style: italic;">those[?]</span>. So, as it was so late that preparing another plate
         would hinder the work, we concluded that it would be best to leave that picture
         out, of this edition at least. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Your mother's face, I
         think, is very good -
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br /> that was just copied from the daguerreotype
         without attempting to give her figure. The engraver had not of course had a
         chance to read the story - he had the daguerreotypes &amp; knew it was a family of
         ransomed slaves - so I suppose he thought he must make them look slavish. Well,
         I should rather people would guess from my story how I looked, than to have them
         see such an ugly picture called by my name. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I think your family will all be pleased with the Dedication - I
         believe I sent you a copy of that in the winter. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I know you are very impatient to see the book - I am myself -
         and it has been so long in the works, it is no wonder. I don't know as I am
         sorry it was not out in the fall, for there was then such a rush of books of the
         same class that it might have stood a poorer chance. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Are any of your children able to read well? Write &amp; let me
         know how you all get along. Much love to Aunt Vina - we would all like to see
         her kind pleasant face once more. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Our family are all in usual health. Tell Aunt Vina Mrs. Lyon's
         baby is the greatest beauty &amp; the sweetest child in the country. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">Ever your friend</p>

      P.S. The daguerreotypes are all safe. I will keep them till you come, unless you
      wish them sent to you. I am very sorry those portraits are a failure. I would
      rather have them <span style="text-decoration: underline;">good</span> than to have all the other
      pictures in the book. You will see they have changed your [mother's] plain neat cap to a turban - that was not done by my direction. I
      requested that Aunt Vina might have on a turban because that looks so much
      more natural, as she always wears one, but I suggested no alterations in your
      mother's dress. If I could have seen the engraver himself, and talked to him
      about you all, so that he would have <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">had an idea</span>
      known what sort of folks you <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">all</span> are, he would have
      done better. If this edition sells well perhaps we can get up a steel plate
      for the next - and I think it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> go off finely. Mr.
      Hamilton is in fine spirits concerning it. K. E. R. Pickard
