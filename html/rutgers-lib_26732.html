      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Uncle Peter</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         I was very glad to receive your
         letter of the 14th ult. and have waited till
         now for good news to write you in reply. But 
         alas! I have little to say that will give you
         hope of a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">speedy</span> union with those dear
         ones, that your heart so yearns to meet.

         I received a letter from sister Julia
         last night in which she says – 
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         "I received your letter about a week ago, and
         the day after it reached me the Doctor was here.
         So I read him his part about Uncle Peter. He
         told me he saw Peter's wife and children only
         a little while ago, and that they were very well.
         He is trying to get Maj. Mc'Kiernan's consent to
         part with them but is obliged to go cautiously 
         to work. Maj. Mc'K. is the Dr. says, a grasping
         avaricious man, and if he were to find out that
         any people were so much interested in Peter's 
         behalf in the North, it would only incite him
         to demand more and more for the wife and 
         children here. The Doctor is very much
         interested for Peter, and wishes most earnestly
         that he might regain his wife and children, 
         but he says he has very little hope that it will
         ever be accomplished."
         
      </p>
      
      <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br />
      
      
      Now I am very sorry my poor friend that I
      cannot write you more encouragement but I
      think I ought not to try to flatter you with
      unreasonable hopes. Still, while there is a
      God in Heaven, we ought not to despair. Don't give 
      up your hope in God, Peter - he often hides his
      mercies for a time behind the gloomiest clouds.
      We cannot tell what he has in store for us. Even 
      if he denies us our fondest wishes, and suffers
      the wicked to triumph over us, he will after
      all make good come out of it, if we trust 
      in Him, and in our hearts resign ourselves to  
      his will. Poor Uncle Tom never got back
      to his wife and children, but how good and how
      holy his sorrows made him because he received
      them in faith and patience. O if you can 
      only have such trust in God, how happy you
      will be, uncle Peter.
      
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         I do not yet feel discouraged about this
         matter- I still hope that some influence will
         be brought to bear on Maj. Mc Kiernan's mind
         that will seduce him to part with those treasures
         so precious to your heart.

         Sister Julia sends me some Tuscumbia
         news – She says Mrs. Armisted Barton died of 
         typhoid fever about the same that that Col Moon 
         died of cancer – That was in December, I believe.
         Col. Meredith, too is dead. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Towns have
         
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br />
         
         removed out of town to their plantation. Uncle
         Billy Winston lives in the Barton house now, but
         intends to go to Texas before long where he can find
         a wild country again. His daughter Miss Mary was married 
         a short time since to Mr Cooper, but very
         much against her father's will. They were married
         in the Methodist Church. They board at Mrs  
         Col. Christian's. Mrs. Lewis, Mrs. Christian's 
         mother, is dead, and so is Mrs. Charles Cooper,
         Mrs. John Christian's mother. Mr. John Christian 
         has given up his store and is now on a boat.
         Mr Penland has left Tuscumbia and has settled
         in Tennessee. Tom Walker has lost all his
         property, is even in debt, and lounges about the streets
         as usual.

      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         That is all the Tuscumbia news she gives me
         I know you will like to hear of some of those
         people that you will not be likely ever to see again.
         You will probably be leaving Boston soon. You
         must let me hear from you often. I cannot
         tell how deep an interest I feel in your welfare
         or how happy it would make me if I could aid in
         restoring your family to you. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We must do all  
            in our power</span> and have the result to that Friend 
         above whose ear is ever open to the cry of the helpless
         if they put their trust in him.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Our family all remember you with much
         
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 4]</small></p><br />
         
         interest. We talk of you often and hope to 
         see you again and to see you happy too.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">Your true friend</p>
      <p style="padding-left:13em; text-indent:-2em;">Kate E. R. Pickard</p>
      
      ⟨
      
      Don't neglect to inform me where you go when
      you leave Boston so that I can write if I have
      good news for you. We expect Sister Julia 
      early in June.
