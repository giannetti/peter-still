      <p style="text-align: left;">My Dear Uncle Peter</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> It is a long time since I wrote you last - have you thought you
         were forgotten, or that I had ceased to feel any interest in your welfare? If
         so, you were greatly mistaken - I have thought of you very often, &amp; have
         sometimes heard from you through Mr. Hamilton, and once in the winter Mr.
         May sent me a letter which he had
         received from you. He wished me to write you then, but I was not able to do
         so.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I do not know whether you have heard anything from us since I
         wrote you last - Our family has greatly changed since then. Mother Pickard died
         at Mr Lyon's on the 9th of last December. She was
         injured by falling on the step as she was going out the door, and died in a few
         hours. Almost at the moment she fell, my baby was born - a little
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> daughter. At the same time a Miss Pickard -
         a cousin of ours was here very ill - so as to be unable to rise alone. It was a
         time of great trouble and you will hardly wonder that during the past winter our
         own cares and sorrows have so absorbed our attention that we have had little
         time or spirits to write letters. I was confined to my room all winter - did not
         go out of the house till the very last of March.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> We are all now in usual health - Grandpa has had a severe
         sickness this Spring - two weeks ago we feared he would never recover, but he is
         now able to ride about. He has failed very much since you were here &amp;
         particularly since Grandma's death.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> My mother is in Buffalo with sister
         Julia who is just recovering from a severe
         [bilious] attack. I am sorry to say her family has received no such addition as
         you were wishing.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Mr Lyon's family are very well. Miss
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> Jennie is at home, and the two little girls
         are growing finely. The little one that was a baby when you were here is a beauty
         &amp; one of the smartest children you ever saw. But tell Aunt Vina, if she wants to see the prettiest, dearest,
         sweetest baby alive she must come &amp; look at my little Jane
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> And so your dear old mother has gone to her reward! You should not mourn for her, Uncle
         Peter, for her sorrows are all past. She lived to suffer much, but her last days
         were cheered by a great joy. Surely her end was peace, and her memory is
         blessed. She is no doubt now rejoicing in the presence of the Blessed One, and
         holding sweet intercourse with the freed spirit of that dear brother whose form
         moulders in a land of slaves.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I am glad your children are all doing well. How do you get
         along in paying for your place? I am glad you have made a good beginning in
         selling your books. Last year there was so much political excitement,
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br /> that no doubt, the sales were slower than
         they would otherwise have been. This year I think you will do still better, and on 
         <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all you sell</span> you get two profits - your share as proprietor
         &amp; the agent's percentage besides. I hope you will be able to push it and get
         off a good number of the books during the year. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You</span> can do
         more than any one else if you do your best. I do not care so much about the
         small profit that I should receive as I do about your doing well. Keep up your
         courage Uncle Peter - you have proved yourself able to accomplish great things.
         Try - and let me hear from you oftener.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I have heard no news from Alabama that
         would interest you, except the death of Mr. Collier last fall &amp; that of Judge 
         Weakly of Florence.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Good bye Uncle Peter - Give much love to Aunt Vina from all of
         us. Can't one of your children write me a note now &amp; then? If they can, I
         will take pleasure in answering it. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">As ever, your true friend</p>
      <p style="padding-left:13em; text-indent:-2em;">Kate E. R. Pickard</p>
