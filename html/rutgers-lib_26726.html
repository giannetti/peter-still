         Peter Still, who carries  this note, is
         one of the most estimable of  men. He wishes to have access to the  great hearts
         of some of the good people of  your city, who have great purses. 
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Please get from him his history,  and his object, and direct
         him what  to do. His integrity may be relied on. 
      </p>
