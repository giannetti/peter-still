         Peter Still, who will hand you this, was
         born free in New Jersey; kidnapped thence when six years old,
         with his brother, two years older, and sold into slavery; served forty years in
         Alabama; finally bought himself free, leaving his wife
         and four children in the hands of the scoundrels who had robbed him of forty
         year's work; and he is now begging more to buy them out of bondage. His
         chivalrous robber <span style="font-style: italic;">[?]</span> asks him $5,000 for his own
         wife and children. It is robbery to buy it, but inhumane to refuse; and as the
         time has not yet arrived for facing such villains with ball and steel rather [than] gold, I wish you could beg him <span style="font-style: italic;">raise a[?]</span>  <span style="font-style: italic;">fort[?]</span> of the many among those
         you know.
