         this side of the grave for although it was [rumored] abroad I could not think it possible that you could or would enjoy such a
         good fortune [as] you [mention] all safe all happy in the place where hearts were made. glad to see you all
         safe &amp; satisfied Dear sir you [most cordially] have mine &amp; [family's] love &amp; respects to you &amp; sister Levina  
         Peter Levin &amp; Catherine you mentioned in your letter that your motive for writing
         was to get some information respecting your little grandson
         Peter he was born March 11<sup>th</sup> 1854 when your family left he was sick &amp;
         hardly expected to live but he is well now and a very fine child and [figuratively] speaking is yourself his head eyes mouth &amp; [complexion] is a perfect picture of you Sir I now mention that I saw Joseph
         Gist and he says that his Mother Brothers &amp; sisters are all well
         also his grandmother and sends their best respects to you &amp; family in regard to
         the fish trap Joseph [does] not seem to hold it but <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br /> but says that it is unprofitable he
         says that he [examined] it and saw that one side was broken down also he says that
         Jno &amp; Louis McKiernan said that you
         left it to them and there was something about the settlement of a
         <span style="font-style: italic;">coat[?]</span> which leaves him not to hold the trap Joseph says that
         since you left him he has felt lost ever since that your departure has filled him
         with Joy and [grief] and more [grief] than Joy also he says you must remember him William
         Handy &amp; family sends respects to you and family
