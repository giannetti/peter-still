      <p style="text-align: right;">June 9.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Sir,</p>
      
       Yesterday I sent you a draft on New York
      for $200. for Peter Still - Today I
      have received yours of the 7th requesting to have the money sent on.
      
      
       Mr Garrison wrote to me
      very promptly at Mr Still's request, but it was not convenient for me to
      send the money until nearly a week after I received the letter -- 
      
      
       Mr Hamilton Willis of
      Boston  
      Mass<sup>tts</sup> - a nephew of mine, is the
      gentleman who gave bonds for the purchase of poor Thomas
      Sims, who had been arraigned for assault &amp; battery, 
      <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> and some other breaches of the Peace, in the
      prosecution of their nefarious undertaking. He happened to be at my house a
      day or two after I received Mr Garrison's letter. I told him Peter Still's
      story. He was deeply interested in it - and immediately said that he thought
      he could induce the gentlemen slaveholders whom he had befriended, and
      who live in Georgia to go and see if they
      cannot make a bargain with the owner of Uncle Peter's
      family - that shall be much more favorable than the one now pending.
      
      
       If Sir you do not succeed
      <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br /> in the application you 
      are now about to make to the owner to take $3000 let me advise you to write
      immediately to Mr Hamilton Willis -  let him know the name of the owner -
      his place of residence, and the persons, who have hitherto been endeavoring
      to negotiate for you -- 
      
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Mr Willis is a very shrewd 
         [skillful] man - one of the principal brokers in Boston - and if he
         undertakes the negotiation - he will effect it, if any man can.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">Yours Respectfully</p>
      <p style="padding-left:13em; text-indent:-2em;">Sam. J. May</p>
      
      ⟨
      Please give my best regards to Peter Still- and tell him he is most kindly remembered
      <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 4]</small></p><br /> by all my family. I have a little money
      that I shall send him when I next write.
