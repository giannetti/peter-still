      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Uncle Peter</p>
      
       I was right glad to <span style="font-style: italic;">learn[?]</span> by
      your letter of the 4<sup>th</sup> from New
      Bedford that you had found friends there, and were likely to
      gather some valuable contributions toward the accomplishment of your great
      object. I hope you have not been disappointed. But I fear you will be obliged to
      raise at least five thousand dollars in order to procure the liberation of your
      wife and children. For some causes, which I do not understand, the price of
      slaves is now higher than it has ever been and according to present prices $5000
      would not be a very exorbitant demand for your family. Nevertheless, go on
      in your labors, perhaps something may happen in the good providence of God to
      favor your wishes.
      
      
       I have not yet received a line from Mr.
      Birney of Philadelphia.
      <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br /> From this I infer that he has heard nothing
      from Alabama that he deems is worthwhile to communicate.
      So soon as I do receive a letter from him, you shall be made acquainted
      with the contents of it.
      
      
       Nor have I heard a word from your friend Mrs Pickard. But I have written to her informing
      her of your progress and I have no doubt that so soon as she shall have any
      thing to communicate, she will send it in a letter to Mr Garrison.
      
      
       Yesterday I sent by my son 
      John Edward, the roll you left with me - D<sup>r</sup> 
      Furness' narrative of Seth Conklin. He expects to be in
      Boston by Saturday night or Sunday <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><span style="font-style: italic;">[?]</span></span><sup>morning</sup> and he will
      give the roll to Mr Garrison for you.
      
      
       All my family are as well as when you left us. They
      remember you very kindly and send to you their best regards. God bless you,
      Uncle Peter.
      
      
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">Yours truly</p>
