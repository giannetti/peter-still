      <p style="text-align: left;">My Dear Peter.</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I have not written to you for a long while for the very
         good reason that I have not known where I could reach you with a letter and
         even now I shall be obliged to let this letter take its chance in finding
         you.
         
      </p>
      
      <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br />
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> You will see by the accompanying letter from Rev.
         S.J. May, Jr. of
         Syracuse, that important information is needed, in
         relation to your family, as you can best <sup>give</sup> the
         information, I hope you will do so without delay. I answered his letter as
         well as I could, but could not name any persons in
         Tuscumbia, &amp;c.
         
      </p>
      
      <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br />
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Mr. Birney did not succeed in his
         undertakings; indeed I doubt very much whether he took much pains in the
         matter. in fact he as good as told me he had done but little. He was very
         anxious to get hold of the money. Edwards M. Davis, who
         holds it, thought that so it was placed where he could [draft] for it at sight, that <sup>that</sup> was all
         sufficient. So it was of course,
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 4]</small></p><br /> but that did not seem to have met Mr.
         Birney's wishes though he consented at the time the arrangement was made
         with him that he was satisfied with it. But I will tell you all about the
         matter when I see you.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> How much money have you raised in all? And when do you
         think of coming on this way?
