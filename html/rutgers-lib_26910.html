      <p style="text-align: right;">9<sup>th</sup> month 19<sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;">th</span></sup> 1854.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Respected Friend.</p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> An extraordinary press of business and sickness in my family
         has prevented an earlier reply to thy letter of the 9<sup>th</sup> I am rejoiced to learn that Peter has been so successful in making
         collections. and he may rest assured that I will not divulge the facts. for I am
         aware that it is all important it should be kept a profound secret. I think that when
         Peter understands the position in which the affair now is that he will recall his
         instructions to me to call on Birney &amp; Goodrich. Soon after Peter requested me to
         act for him I became satisfied after as thorough investigation as the circumstances
         would admit of that the negotiation for the purchase of his family woud never be
         carried to a successful termination by correspondence and therefore despatched a
         gentleman (in whom I have full confidence) to Florence Ala
         with <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> instructions if he could get possession of the wife and children and carry them to
         Cincinnati. I instructed him to place himself under the
         advice and direction of John Simpson an
         old personal friend and wealthy merchant to whom I wrote giving him all the facts
         and
         asking his personal interest and attention. Simpson recollected Peter and promised
         to
         give all the aid in his power; but he said the owner had been so frequently
         approached by letter and otherwise that it would be very unwise for my agent to go
         to
         him; that his feeling towards Peter was very bitter and that the family could not
         now
         be bought on any terms. He said further that if we would place the affair in his
         hands he would embrace the earliest opportunity of carrying out our views. 
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Thou will readily perceive that in this position of affairs it would be very unwise
         again to call on Birney &amp; Goodrich who are not lawyers but are proprietors of
         what is known here as a Commercial Agency. The amount named to Simpson as the sum
         Peter can pay for his family is $3500. and he is
         authorized to draw on me at sight for that amount wherever he can make
         the purchase. I think it would be unwise to let Simpson know that. Peter can <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><span style="font-style: italic;">raise[?]</span></span> command <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br /> a larger
         sum and I would 
         <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">ardently</span>
         <sup>earnestly</sup>
          advise the latter not to move in the matter in any way until he again hears
         from me. 
      </p>
