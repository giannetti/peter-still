      <p style="text-align: right;">Syracuse</p>
      <p style="text-align: right;">Apr. 27. '55</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Friend.</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I have almost made up my mind, that L.W. Hall &amp; Co of
         this city will be the best persons to publish your life of Uncle Peter and Family. He has business connections with
         the largest publishing houses in Boston, New
         York and 
         Philadelphia - and assures me he can throw the book into the
         market everywhere as favorably as if it were published in either of those
         cities. He has been the publisher of several large works - and is a man of tact
         and enterprise. The principal reason why I think it would be better to have the
         work published here, is that it would here be in some measure under your
         supervision - and might receive your last touches. We have too excellent
         engravers in Syracuse, who might prepare your
         illustrations under your directions.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Mess<sup>rs</sup> Hall &amp; Co will assume the risk of
         the whole publication and pay probably
         15 cents on <sup>every</sup> copy sold,
         to Uncle Peter and yourself i.e. that's a piece
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br /> subject to the arrangement you have made
         with each other.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> If you conclude to let Mess<sup>rs</sup> Hall &amp; Co take the work - it will be well - so soon as you
         have done with D<sup>r</sup> 
         Furness' manuscripts, to let me send them to
         him that he may immediately put them in order for publication, and return
         them as soon as possible, that that part of the volume may be in the press,
         which you are completing your part. This will expedite the publication of the
         book, which ought to be issued so soon as it can be without hurrying you.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Then again, so soon as you have determined upon the
         illustrations, it would be well to have them in the hands of the engraver, that
         he may have time enough to do his work well.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> My wife has been very unwell for more than a week with fever -
         She is getting better - still she is very weak and requires much attention. If
         therefore uncle Peter and his wife come to Syracuse any
         time within the ensuing fortnight or three weeks - it is my wish that they
         should sojourn with some other one of their friends. If my wife were
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 4]</small></p><br /> well, it would be a great pleasure to me to
         have them stay at my house.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">Yours truly</p>
      <p style="padding-left:13em; text-indent:-2em;">Samuel J. May.</p>
