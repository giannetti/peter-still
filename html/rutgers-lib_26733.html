         I desire to certify that I am
         acquainted with Mr. Peter Still, have
         examined all his papers, &amp; am <span style="font-style: italic;">entirely[?]</span>
         satisfied of the truthfulness of his story

         sympathy &amp; beneficence of the community
         It does not seem possible that any further
         commendation of a Christian brother's appeal
         to the charity of men should be needed
         than the fact the he desires to be
         the owner of his wife and family. So far
         as any word of mine can help him, I
         most cordially recommend him to the

         favorable consideration of the humane.
