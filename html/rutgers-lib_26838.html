         The bearer of this is Peter Still.
         His story is a remarkable one, but well
         authenticated. I have examined all his
         papers, and have received letters testifying
         to his excellent character from 
         persons who knew him in Alabama.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         He was stolen from the banks of
         the Delaware River, when a child of
         five or six years of age; and sold 
         into slavery in Kentucky. There he 
         lived thirteen years; and was then
         sold and carried to Alabama and
         kept in slavery thirty one years longer.
         By extraordinary exertion and the
         greatest carefulness, he succeeded in
         accumulating five hundred dollars,
         which he paid to his master, and was set
         free.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         He came to the North, and by a most 
         singular providence, he found brothers 
         and sisters living in Philadelphia, and
         his aged mother still alive in New Jersey,
         where he had left her when he was 
         stolen. 
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Having recovered his own liberty, he is 
         now eager to procure the freedom of his
         
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br />
         
         wife and children, two sons and a daughter.
         It is hoped that their liberation may
         be obtained for $3,500. This may seem to
         many a large sum; but what is it in comparison 
         with the gift of liberty to four
         human beings? If every one who has heard 
         or may hear Peter Still's story, will only 
         give him what he or she can well afford,
         the sum will soon be raised.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         About fifteen hundred dollars have
         already been collected, and Peter Still
         has now come to Syracuse, to ask assistance
         from the benevolent of this thriving 
         city.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         We the undersigned promise to pay
         this sum set against our names 
         Peter Still, on his order, to be appropriated
         to the payment of the price demanded
         for the liberation of his wife
         sons, and daughter.
