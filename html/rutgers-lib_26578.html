      <p style="text-align: right;">Jan. 29, 1853</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Uncle Pete</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I was very happy to receive  your letter of the 8th inst. We were all glad to hear from you,
         and glad that there is a prospect of you receiving aid in
         Boston. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I received a letter from sister Julia on
         the last day of December. She expresses much
          interest in your success and Dr. Hargraves
         will do all in his power to induce Maj. McKiernan to let your
         family go. If no attempt had been made to run them off it would not be
         difficult to buy them but Maj. McKiernan being  a
         hot-headed politician was very much enraged by that attempt, and probably
         meant, when he told Mr.
         Thorton that he would not take less than $5000 - that he would not not sell them at all.
          I trust however, that he may be induced to  let them go. The Dr. has
         enlisted Judge Weakley's
          interest in your behalf, and you need not  fear that any effort on
         his part will be wanting  In the mean time you must work yourself  and
         be careful to maintain a right spirit.  Do not cherish bitter or resentful
         feelings at 
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> the delay of your hopes. Trust in that
         God without whose notice not a sparrow falls to the  ground. These are
         day of trial - do not let your  patience fail. 
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> It is very hard and unkind in Maj.
         McKiernan
          to ask such a high price for your family, and even  to be unwilling
         to sell them at all, but you must  not speak harshly of him or even let
         your thoughts  dwell too much on that part of the subject.  It will do
         you no good - it will make you no friends  to indulge such feelings but it
         will injure your  character. You will not be so well fitted to  enjoy
         the company of your wife and children,
         if you  let your temper become soured before you meet  them. I write
         this to caution you - for  I know it is hard for any one to keep a meek
          and quiet spirit when he knows he has been,  and is, suffering
         unkindness and injury. 
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Sister Julia says in her letter "Tell
         Peter  his master young John
         Hogan is dead and the  elder Mr. Hogan
         and his wife have both become  Christians and united with the Presbyterian
         Church  in Tuscumbia. Miss Maria Cockburn
          married a Mr. Lavender, a dancing master,  in
         Tuscumbia, and in consequence, all the  family
         have cast her off. They do not even  recognize her when they meet in the
         street. <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br /> His old friend Mr.
         Brady was married a few weeks  since to a Miss
         Johnson of Kentucky and has gone
          to New Orleans to live. Please give him  these
         bits of information - I can think of no other 
         Tuscumbia news that would interest him.  Remember me
         to him most kindly. Assure  him too, that everything will be done that can
          be to get his wife and children, but tell him  not to be too sure,
         for he may be disappointed.  Poor fellow! it will be hard, if after
         cherishing  his dream of happiness so many years, he must  then be so
         cruelly disappointed! Tell him  I'll be home in
         June, and then I hope I'll  have the pleasure of looking into
         his good  kind honest face once more." 
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I have copied the close of Sister Julia's  letter, that
         you may have it in her own words.  When I hear from her again, or from Dr.
         Hargraves
          I will write you - I should have sent you  this information earlier,
         but Mr. Pickard and 
         my little Willie have been ill and 
         have taken all my time and care. They are better  now however. 
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I trust that the next letter I receive <sup>from the South</sup> will  contain more encouraging news. It
         is some  comfort to know that there are warm hearts there  enlisted in
         your favor. If you make any 
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 4]</small></p><br /> change in your plans, let me know, and
          be assured you have the warm sympathy of 
      </p>
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">Your friend</p>
