      <p style="text-align: left;">Dr. [John] C. Lord,<br /> My Dear Pastor,
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> The bearer of this is Peter
         Still, a freeman, seeking aid, to obtain possession of his wife &amp; children, slaves in
         Alabama. He himself was kidnapped when six years of age,
         taken from N.J. to 
         Kentucky &amp; there sold as a slave. From Ky. he was taken to
         Ala. There, after having worked faithfully 44 years, he, by the aid of a 
         Jew, found means to buy himself. The
         hope of once more finding his home &amp; friends had ever been most warmly,
         though secretly, cherished. By a series of most wonderful Providences, he found
         them, his mother &amp; many brothers &amp; sisters. He, then returned to Ala. on
         a pass from his Jew master (he being, in the South, supposed to be a slave) told
         his wife &amp; children of his success &amp; that he should now work for them.
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> He went again to N.J. &amp; there for more
         than a year worked sometimes at the rate of 
         $10 pr. month, some of the time at $15 with the hope of earning enough to free his
         family. Some friends advised him to try to raise it by contributions. (The sum
         demanded is $5000) He did try &amp; has succeeded
         in raising the entire sum. Now he needs $200 to
         bear their expenses here.
         
      </p>
      
       During my residence in the South I knew him well &amp; always knew him as honest,
      faithful &amp; industrious. I know him to be strictly truthful one upon whose
      word you may rely implicitly. You will, if you have time, be much interested in
      his simple story.
      
      
       You will see from a letter in his possession the necessity that seems to exist for
      his remaining as quiet as possible, this will account to you for his going so
      with letters of introduction to different individuals, rather than appearing in
      public.
      
      
       I know, my dear pastor, that your heart is ever
      <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br /> touched with the sorrows of the afflicted
      &amp; of the lowly, that your ear is ever open to a tale of suffering. For this
      reason I commend him to you, hoping that you may be able to assist him.
      
      
       From a recent accident, the dislocation of my ankle, I am closely confined at
      present but were it not so, my acquaintance in Buffalo is
      too limited to enable me to do him all the good I would.
      
      
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">Most truly Yours,</p>
      <p style="padding-left:13em; text-indent:-2em;">Julia E. R. Marvin.</p>
