      <p style="text-align: right;">Syracuse,</p>
      <p style="text-align: right;">Oct. 7, 1854</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Friends</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         		The bearer of this
         		will be Peter Still -- one of the
         		most remarkable of the many
         		who have recently come out of
         		the horrid bondage of the American
         		democratic slave system.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         		His story is a peculiar one - as
         		also the story of his friend Seth 
         		  Conkling. I leave Mr Still to give
         		his own narrative. You may rely
         		upon all he tells you - for a
         		more truthful man does not
         		live.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         		He has nearly accomplished
         		his arduous undertaking - has
         		raised nearly enough to pay
         		for the release of his family and
         		bear the expenses of their removal
         		to their new home in some
         one of the nominally free states
         		of our Union. Do help him to the
         		residue --
         
      </p>
