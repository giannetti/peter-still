      <p style="text-align: right;">Buffalo</p>
      <p style="text-align: right;">June 24th 1855</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Uncle Peter</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Why have you not written me how you are prospering all this
         long time? I have not heard a word from you, except that your brother William said in his letter that you and your
         family were well. I would like to know where you are and what you are doing, and
         how my dear Aunt Vina gets along. By the
         way, Uncle Peter, I think from your brother's letter that you did not understand
         my object in asking the questions which he refuses to answer. I had no intention
         of publishing any thing that could in any way injure your mother's family. I merely
         wished 
         <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to know the facts</span> that I might have an idea in my own mind of
         the circumstances &amp; characteristics of your parents <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">so
            th</span> and so be able to make the description of them more interesting than
         I can do with so few facts before me. Then I thought that those questions might
         elicit from your mother some little circumstances, trifling in themselves
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> that would so manifest the affection or
         energy of your parents as be worthy of a place in the "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Narrative</span>." <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">while</span>
         <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">they</span> I am sorry your friends have so little
         confidence in me as to suppose that I would by any means risk their safety or
         happiness.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I came here about two weeks ago, for the sake of being free
         from household cares so that I might spend all my time in writing. I have at
         last succeeded in getting a good girl – <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> you will
         be glad to know. My mother is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">ta</span>
         keeping house for me in my absence, and I have Willie with me here. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Our family are all in usual health –  I have just
         received a letter from home mailed 22nd.
         Mr Pickard is not yet well, though he is
         rather more comfortable than he was when you were at our house. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Grandpa and grandma are very well this summer, and tell Aunt
         Vina Mrs. Lyon and that dear little Mary
         are doing first rate. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Sister Julia is very
         pleasantly situated and enjoys house keeping exceedingly. I think you would
         enjoy <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">seeing</span> visiting her now, and I know she would
         like to see you. I saw a friend of yours here a day or two
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br /> since, a Mrs. Williams that took a deep
         interest in your cause when you visited Buffalo. She inquired kindly of your welfare and that of your
         family, and expressed great anxiety on the subject of getting Peter's child.
         Have you heard any thing from the little boy? Do you intend to try to get it this
         summer? I do hope that little fellow may be rescued from a life of slavery. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I shall probably remain here three or four weeks longer unless
         something unexpected should occur to call me home. But if you write to me, and I
         hope you will, direct to Camillus – Mr. Pickard is writing to me every two or three days
         &amp; he will forward the letter. I want very much to hear from you. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Give very much love from me to that good Aunt Vina, and tell
         her that not one of our family has forgot to love her. Take good care of her
         Uncle Peter, and also of yourself. I hope your children are all thriving. Tell
         them they must remember that their friends expect great things of them. They are
         anxious that they should show the world that freedom is better than slavery. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">Your true friend</p>
