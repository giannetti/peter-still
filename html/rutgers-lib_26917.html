      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Uncle Peter</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         I am once more at home and
         think I will delay no longer to write you. I 
         have waited a few days hoping to see Mr
         May before I wrote you.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         The first half of the Narrative is
         ready for the press. Mr. May is coming out
         to read it - I have been looking for him
         every day for more than a week.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Mr Hall of Syracuse will probably publish
         it. And now about your coming to
         hear it read. When will it be most convenient 
         for you to come? Mr. Hall will be 
         anxious to get at it as soon as possible, and 
         it is important that there should be no
         delay. If it were not for your hearing
         it first, I could let him have the first
         part soon, and that could be set up.
         But I have not seen him recently - he
         will, I expect come with Mr. May in a few
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br />
         days, to hear it read; and then I will write
         you again, and let you know what <sup>are</sup> his wishes
         concerning it.

         Sister Julia is quite well, as are also
         our family. Mr Pickard has been quite
         out of health this summer, but he is now
         as well as usual. Willie sends his love
         to Uncle Peter and Aunt Vina, and wishes
         very much to see them. He says "Mama, 
         what <span style="text-decoration: underline;">did</span> they go away for?
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Lydia has come back. She went 
         home about the last of May, and was to
         stay three days, but she was gone more
         than two months. She seems very
         happy now, but does not talk.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         Much love from all of us to dear Aunt
         Vina, as well as to yourself. [Everybody] I
         <sup>meet</sup> inquires about you, and all seem very anxious
         to see that wonderful book.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         I hope your family all continues to do
         well. Give my best wishes to them, and
         tell them <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">that</span> they must remember that
         [everybody] is watching them to see if it
         pays to buy people out of slavery.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         I am anxious to hear from Peter's poor
         little boy. I do wish Aunt Vina had it
         in her arms this minute.
         
      </p>

      <p style="text-indent:4em;">
         I will write again after I have seen
         Mr. May &amp; Mr. Hall. I thought you
         would like to hear how the book is 
         getting on, and so I would wait no longer.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">As ever, your friend</p>
      <p style="padding-left:13em; text-indent:-2em;">Kate E. R. Pickard.</p>
