      <p style="text-align: right;">Nov. 2. 1853</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Sir</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I received last evening your favor of 
         29<sup>th</sup>. Please send me
         immediately the names of Uncle Peter's wife and children, the name of the town where they live, of the
         person who dares to hold them as his property, and the names of such
         persons in the neighborhood as you know would be friendly to our attempt to
         obtain the liberty of your brother’s family.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I fear it will be difficult for [anyone] to make any proposal to purchase
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> them without awakening the suspicion of
         their master that they are to be bought for Peter, in which case he will demand $5,000 for them - as so
         long as he has any hopes of getting that exhorbitant price for them from
         Peter and his friends - he will not let [anybody] else have them for less money.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Will it not be necessary for Peter to abandon the
         intention of purchasing them at $5000 and let the monster know that he has
         abandoned it.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">Yours truly</p>
      <p style="padding-left:13em; text-indent:-2em;">Sam. J. May</p>
      
      <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br />
      
      ⟨
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> I shall write immediately to my <span style="font-style: italic;">kinsman[?]</span> in 
         Boston - and, if he consents to undertake the business
         I wish to be in readiness to furnish him with all the information he may
         need.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> You know I have two hundred
         dollars in my care belonging to Peter Still. It is drawing 7
         per cent interest - and therefore had better be left here until he needs
         it.
