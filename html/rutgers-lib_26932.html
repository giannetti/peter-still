      <p style="text-align: right;">March 5, 1875</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Mr. Still:</p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> The postman has just brought me your letter of the 3d inst., so that my reply can hardly reach you in
         season for your Committee meeting to-morrow noon.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Please say to the Committee that I am very much obliged to them
         for their courteous invitation to me to attend the centennial anniversary of
         the Pennsylvania Society for promoting the Abolition of Slavery, &amp;e.,
         next month; but there is no prospect that I shall be able to be present, for
         I am still a good deal crippled and a constant sufferer from a rheumatic
         ailment which has afflicted me for the last two years, though I am at
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> present somewhat better than formerly. I
         should almost be willing to undertake a pedestrian tour to Philadelphia, if I
         could only be assured of the free use of my limbs by the time the celebration is
         to come off.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> If I can do no more, I will at least try to send a letter,
         expressive of my feelings, to be read on the occasion as a substitute for
         my presence, should the Committee think proper.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> How deeply it is to be regretted that the common school
         provision <sup>(as intended by Mr. Sumner)</sup> was eliminated from
         the Civil Rights Bill! Yet the passage of the Bill as it is, by Congress, is
         more than Southern Rebeldom can bear, and will doubtless lead to many scenes of
         violence; but it indicates progress in the right direction. No doubt an attempt
         will be made to
         <br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br /> repeal it at the next session of Congress,
         and perhaps successfully, by the Rebel-Democracy, into whose hands it now looks
         as if the control of the Government is to pass at the close of
         Grant's administration. How he is hated and maligned, and
         also feared, by all the enemies of equal rights, North and South!
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="text-indent:4em;"> But, though the prospect is a dark one, let us abate nothing of
         heart or hope as to the final result, which, if the friends of impartial
         freedom remain true to the cause which they long ago espoused under far
         more trying circumstances, cannot fail to be still more in accordance with
         the claims of justice and humanity than our present highest attainment.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">Faithfully yours,</p>
      <p style="padding-left:13em; text-indent:-2em;">W<sup>m.</sup> Lloyd
         Garrison
