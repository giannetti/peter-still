"May, Samuel J., letter, Syracuse, [N.Y.], February 28, 1861, to ""Uncle Peter"" [Peter Still]","May, Samuel J. (Samuel Joseph), 1797-1871","","The Rev. Samuel J. May explains to Peter Still the circumstances, as he has been able to ascertain them, of the sale of the copyright and stereotype plates of Still's published narrative (after the bankruptcy of the publisher), which went first to Still’s friend Mr. Parrish and then to a Mr. Jones of London; indicates his resulting conclusion that Mrs. Pickard was not at fault for what happened to the plates, despite Still’s perception; presumes that printing in London is cheaper than in New York, so that for Still to purchase an edition of the book now would likely not be more expensive than formerly; provides advice regarding Still’s dispute with a Mr. Smith over the price of Still's house and land, suggesting that “three good men” be selected to act as arbitrators; and notes in a postscript that he recently visited Catharine [Still], who is unhappy with her situation at the Onondaga Academy, as she “thinks she does not receive as much instruction as she ought to.”","1861-02-28","Text","Correspondence","4 p.","rutgers-lib:26923","http://hdl.rutgers.edu/1782.1/rucore00000002022.Manuscript.000051591","doi:10.7282/T3KW5G58","Peter Still papers, 1850-1875","Rutgers Community Repository (RUcore)","public domain","http://francescagiannetti.com/still/plugins/Dropbox/files/26923.pdf"
