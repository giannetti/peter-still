          I was very glad to receive your<lb />

          now for good news to write you in reply. But<lb /> 
          alas! I have little to say that will give you<lb />

          I received a letter from <persName ref="psn:marvin_julia">sister Julia</persName><lb />
          last night in which she says – <lb />
        </p>
        
        <p rendition="#indent">
          "I received your letter about a week ago, and<lb />
          the day after it reached me the Doctor was here.<lb />
          So I read him his part about Uncle Peter. He<lb />
          told me he saw Peter's <persName ref="psn:vina_still">wife</persName> and children only<lb />
          a little while ago, and that they were very well.<lb />
          He is trying to get <persName ref="psn:mckiernan_bernard">Maj. Mc'Kiernan's</persName> consent to<lb />
          part with them but is obliged to go cautiously<lb /> 
          to work. Maj. Mc'K. is the Dr. says, a grasping<lb />
          avaricious man, and if he were to find out that<lb />
          any people were so much interested in Peter's<lb /> 
          behalf in the North, it would only incite him<lb />
          to demand more and more for the wife and<lb /> 
          children here. The Doctor is very much<lb />
          interested for Peter, and wishes most earnestly<lb />
          that he might regain his wife and children,<lb /> 
          but he says he has very little hope that it will<lb />
          ever be accomplished."

          Now I am very sorry my poor friend that I<lb />
          cannot write you more encouragement but I<lb />
          think I ought not to try to flatter you with<lb />
          unreasonable hopes. Still, while there is a<lb />
          God in Heaven, we ought not to despair. Don't give<lb /> 
          up your hope in God, Peter - he often hides his<lb />
          mercies for a time behind the gloomiest clouds.<lb />
          We cannot tell what he has in store for us. Even<lb /> 
          if he denies us our fondest wishes, and suffers<lb />
          the wicked to triumph over us, he will after<lb />
          all make good come out of it, if we trust<lb /> 
          in Him, and in our hearts resign ourselves to<lb />  <!-- added transcription for this line -->
          his will. Poor Uncle Tom never got back<lb />
          to his wife and children, but how good and how<lb />
          holy his sorrows made him because he received<lb />
          them in faith and patience. O if you can<lb /> 
          only have such trust in God, how happy you<lb />
          will be, uncle Peter.<lb />
        </p>

        <p rendition="#indent">
          I do not yet feel discouraged about this<lb />
          matter- I still hope that some influence will<lb />
          be brought to bear on Maj. Mc Kiernan's mind<lb />
          that will seduce him to part with those treasures<lb />
          so precious to your heart.<lb />

          Sister Julia sends me some <placeName>Tuscumbia</placeName><lb />
          news – She says <persName>Mrs. Armisted Barton</persName> died of<lb /> 
          typhoid fever about the same that that <persName>Col Moon</persName><lb /> 
          died of cancer – That was in December, I believe.<lb />
          <persName>Col. Meredith</persName>, too is dead. Mr. &amp; Mrs. <persName>Towns</persName> have<lb />
          
          <pb n="3" facs="../images/26732_3.png" />

          removed out of town to their plantation. Uncle<lb />

          intends to go to <placeName>Texas</placeName> before long where he can find<lb />
          a wild country again. His daughter <persName>Mrs. Mary</persName> was married<lb /> 
          a short time since to <persName>Mr. Cooper</persName>, but very<lb />
          much against her father's will. They were married<lb />
          in the Methodist Church. They board at Mrs.<lb /> 
          <persName>Col. Christian's</persName>. <persName>Mrs. Lewis</persName>, Mrs. Christian's<lb /> 
          mother, is dead, and so is <persName>Mrs. Charles Cooper</persName>,<lb />
          Mr. John Christian's mother. Mr. John Christian<lb /> 
          has given up his store and is now on a boat.<lb />
          <persName>Mr. Penland</persName> has left <placeName>Tuscumbia</placeName> and has settled<lb />
