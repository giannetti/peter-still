        <p rendition="#indent">
          <hi rendition="#u">The Book is at last out</hi>.<lb/> I saw Mr. Hamilton on Saturday. He
          had<lb/> received a few copies by Express, though it is<lb/> not advertised for sale until
          the <date when="1856-06-05"><unclear>5th</unclear> June</date>.<lb/> It looks very well -
          the paper is nice and<lb/> the type clear - indeed the whole looks inviting<lb/> and
          interesting. The head of your mother<lb/> is excellent. If they had only copied the
          other<lb/> daguerreotypes as well they would have looked<lb/> very natural.<lb/>
        </p>

        <p rendition="#indent"> Mr Hamilton requested me to write you<lb/> immediately to ask you to
          come right on<lb/> and take an agency to sell the book. He<lb/> thinks you could sell more
          than any other<lb/> one man, and the profit you would make<lb/> would pay you well. His
          plan is to have<lb/> you visit the same places which you visited<lb/> while collecting
          money. Few that aided you,<lb/> even if they gave you but a trifle, would<lb/> refuse to
          buy a book if you presented it.<lb/>
        </p>

        <p rendition="#indent"> The Book contains 409 pages, and is to<lb/> sell at <measure
            type="currency">$1,25</measure>. Mr. <persName ref="psn:samuel_may">May</persName>'s
          Introduction is <lb/> very beautiful. I think all your friends will<lb/> like it very
          much.<lb/>
        </p>

        <pb n="2" facs="../images/26926_2.png"/>

        <p rendition="#indent"> Would you like my advice about going out to<lb/> sell the books? I
          think if your family can<lb/> get along comfortably without you it will be<lb/> the best
          thing you can do to take the agency as<lb/> proposed by Mr. Hamilton. He will give
          you<lb/> the same profit that he does to other agents,<lb/> and you know, the more copies
          are sold, the<lb/> more <hi rendition="#u">our ten per cent</hi> will amount to.<lb/>
          There is so much excitement at present about<lb/> Slavery, that many of our friends are
          glad<lb/> the publication of the book has been delayed<lb/> till just this time. I have
          many things<lb/> to tell you about it, but I hope to see you<lb/> soon, so I will leave
          them.<lb/>
        </p>

        <p rendition="#indent"> Please write immediately to let us know<lb/> whether or not to
          expect you. The quicker you<lb/> come on, the better it will be for the book.<lb/> Be sure
          to write as soon as you get this, &amp; <lb/> if you decide to take the agency, come on.
          Come<lb/> here first, and I will go with you to <placeName>Syracuse</placeName><lb/> to
          see Mr. Hamilton.<lb/>
        </p>

        <p rendition="#indent"> Much love to Aunt <persName ref="psn:vina_still">Vina</persName>
          &amp; your children.<lb/> I am glad to hear that they are all doing<lb/> well.<lb/>
