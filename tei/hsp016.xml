          <salute>Dear <persName ref="#wileyeda">Edward</persName>:</salute>
        </opener>
        <p>
          Your letter of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> inst. <lb/> <del rend="strikethrough">came to</del> came to hand today and I was gratified<lb/> not a little to hear that your health is<lb/> “improving so nicely”. It was not altogether<lb/> gratifying however to learn that you are<lb/> feeling “<choice><sic>doubtfull</sic><corr>doubtful</corr></choice> about making a successful<lb/> canvass in <placeName>Newport</placeName>,” that “agents have been<lb/> canvassing in the place before” your <unclear>arrival</unclear> <lb/> <persName>Harvey</persName> of <del rend="strikethrough">N</del> <placeName>Providence</placeName> is the <unclear resp="#jd">man</unclear> I <unclear resp="#jd">reserve</unclear>.<lb/> I was not aware that Miss <unclear resp="#jd"/>Gainsworth<lb/> was attempting to do anything.
        </p>
        <p>
	      Now as to what you have better do under<lb/> the circumstances, I can only say this,<lb/> if you see that it will not pay to <unclear resp="#jd">tarry</unclear><lb/> for a few weeks, were I in your stead<lb/> I would go to <placeName>Hartford</placeName> or <placeName>New <unclear resp="#jd">Haven</unclear></placeName> and<lb/> in this connection also I might name <unclear resp="#jd">Martha's</unclear><lb/> Vineyard, in <placeName>Mass.</placeName> 28 or 30 miles from <lb/> <placeName>New Bedford</placeName> - as a summer resort and<lb/> watering place it stands very high. As your<lb/> health is improving this is every thing. With<lb/> good health you can make money, but<lb/> not so with bad health - So you have no<lb/> right to feel discouraged with your<lb/> visit down East. It is all as Providence
    <pb n="2"/>
          (not Providence in R.I.) would have<lb/> it perhaps, so take it calmly and the<lb/> end will all come out right.
        </p>
        <p>
	      In <placeName>Newark</placeName> &amp; <placeName>New Brunswick<lb/> N.J.</placeName> on your way home, I judge it<lb/> would pay you to stop. The rest I will<lb/> leave you to fill up.
        </p>
        <p>
	      <persName ref="#stillcavm">Carrie</persName> and the baby went yesterday<lb/> to Atlantic City, to comply with <unclear cert="medium" resp="#jd">Mrs</unclear> Jones'<lb/> invitation. Jones is still there quite sick<lb/> but hopes to be well enough by Saturday<lb/> to come home.
        </p>
        <p>
	      The rest of the family are<lb/> all well except I am in possession<lb/> of a desperate bad cold which I would<lb/> be pleased to get rid of very soon.<lb/> But we are not to have all sunshine<lb/> in this world. We must have clouds<lb/> and head winds occasionally. Our father<lb/> above is very good and will stand by<lb/> us faithfully if we will do right.<lb/> So let us be of good cheer.
        </p>
