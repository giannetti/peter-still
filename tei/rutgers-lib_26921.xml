          days longer. Mr. Hamilton has taken as<lb />
          partner in this business the Firm of Miller,<lb />
          Orton, + Mulligan, of Auburn - one of the<lb />
          best publishing houses in the state. They<lb />

          Mr Hamilton showed me the proof of<lb />
          the pictures the last time I saw him.<lb />
          <pb n="2" facs="../images/26921_2.png" />
          They all suited me very well except the<lb />
          portraits of yourself and family - and they<lb />
          looked no more like you <add place="above">all</add> than if they had<lb />
          been made entirely by guess. I sent your<lb />
          daguerreotypes to the Engraver, but somehow<lb />
          or other he blundered sadly. You never<lb />
          saw a meaner looking set of "<hi rendition="#u">darkies</hi>" than<lb />
          he made you out to be. He had you seated<lb />
          in front with your head down, looking as <choice><corr>though</corr><sic>thoug</sic></choice><lb />
          you had just taken a "<hi rendition="#u">cutting</hi> <hi rendition="#u">up</hi>" + expected<lb />
          soon to receive another. Aunt Vina they<lb />
          had standing before you - a big woman - about<lb />
          like our big Sally - looking no more like herself<lb />
          than she looks like me - except the<lb />
          color - and the children standing in the background<lb />
          looked no better.

          I told Mr. Hamilton I should object<lb />
          to publishing such a thing as that for<lb />
          your family - it would be an insult to<lb /> 
          you + to your friends. He thought so too<lb />
          - he had never seen you, he said, but from<lb />
          what he had heard of you, he thought you<lb />
          must be different looking people from <unclear>this</unclear>.<lb />
          So, as it was so late that preparing another<lb />
          plate would hinder the work, we concluded<lb />
          that it would be best to leave that<lb />
          picture out, of this edition at least.

          that was just copied from the daguerreotype<lb />
          without attempting to give her figure.<lb />
          The engraver had not of course had a<lb /> 
          chance to read the story - he had the daguerreotypes<lb /> 
          + knew it was a family of ransomed<lb />
          slaves - so I suppose he thought he must<lb />
          make them look slavish. Well, I should<lb />
          rather people would guess from my story how<lb />
          I looked, than to have them see such an<lb />
          ugly picture called by my name.

          I think your family will all be pleased<lb />

          don't know as I am sorry it was not out in<lb />
          the fall, for there was then such a rush of<lb />
          books of the same class that it might have<lb />

          <p>P.S. The daguerreotypes are all safe. I will<lb />
          keep them till you come, unless you wish them<lb />
          sent to you. I am very sorry those portraits<lb />
          are a failure. I would rather have<lb />
          them <hi rendition="#u">good</hi> than to have all the other pictures<lb />
          in the book. You will see they have<lb /> 
          changed your <choice><corr>mother's</corr><sic>mothers</sic></choice> plain neat cap to a<lb />
          turban - that was not done by my direction.<lb />
          I requested that Aunt Vina might have on<lb />
          a turban because that looks so much more<lb />
          natural, as she always wears one, but I<lb /> 
          suggested no alterations in your mother's dress. If<lb />
          I could have seen the engraver himself, and<lb />
          talked to him about you all, so that he would<lb />
          have <del rend="strikethrough">had an idea</del> known what sort of folks<lb /> 
          you <del rend="strikethrough">all</del> are, he would have done better. If<lb />
          this edition sells well perhaps we can get up a<lb /> 
          steel plate for the next - and I think it <hi rendition="#u">will</hi><lb />
          go off finely - Mr. Hamilton is in fine spirits<lb />
          concerning it. K. E. R. Pickard</p>
