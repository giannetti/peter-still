            <p style="text-align: left;">My dear [Brother]</p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;"> The bearer Peter [Still] is one of God[']s own poor from the  land
               of bondage who having bought  his own body, is now endeavouring  to raise money
               to purchase his wife &amp; children. I know, you &amp; other  friends of a Common Redeemer 
               &amp; of a common humanity will do  what is needful to accomplish an  object so
               dear to the heart of this  child of God. Unless the owner of his family like some other fiends  in human shape refuse to part with 
               them, so soon as he finds that the  funds are secured, I think
               Peter will one day call his wife his &amp;
                children his own. Mrs. Hoyt says <br /><h4>Page: 2</h4><br />["]tell Mr Williston that [though] the <span style="font-style: italic;">[?]</span> have <span style="font-style: italic;">burned
                  of[?]</span> his  house, I know that they have  not <span style="font-style: italic;">burned[?]</span>
               out the goodness  of his heart." May God  second the efforts of this hitherto <span style="font-style: italic;">oppressed[?]</span> one to <span style="font-style: italic;">compass[?]</span> the objects  so dear
               to his heart 
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;"> Very truly yours </p>
