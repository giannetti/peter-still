          I have almost made up<lb />
          my mind, that L.W. Hall &amp; Co of this<lb />
          city will be the best persons to publish<lb />
          your life of <persName ref="psn:peter_still">Uncle Peter</persName> and Family.<lb />
          He has business connections with the largest<lb />
          publishing house in Boston, New York and<lb />
          Philadelphia - and assures me he can<lb />
          <unclear>throw</unclear> the book into the market every<lb />
          where as favorably as if it were published<lb />
          in either of those cities. He has been<lb />
          the publisher of several large works - and<lb /> 
          is a man of tact and enterprise.<lb />
          The principal reason why I think it<lb />
          would be better to have the work published<lb />
          here, is that it would here be<lb />
          in some measure under your supervision<lb />
          - and might receive your last<lb />
          touches. We have too excellent engravers<lb />
          in <placeName>Syracuse</placeName>, who might prepare your<lb />
          illustrations under your directions.<lb />
        </p>
        
        <p rendition="#indent">
          L.W. Hall &amp; Co will assume the risk<lb />
          of the whole publication and pay probably<lb />
          15 cents on <add place="above">every</add> copy sold, to Uncle<lb />
          Peter and yourself i.e. that's a piece<lb />

          <pb n="3" facs="../images/26914_3.png" />

          subject to the arrangement you have<lb />
          made with each other.<lb />
        </p>
        
        <p rendition="#indent">
          If you conclude to let L.W. Hall &amp; Co<lb />
          take the work - it will be well - so soon<lb />
          as you have done with <persName ref="psn:furness">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Furness'</persName> manuscripts,<lb />
          to let me send them to him<lb />
          that he may immediately put them in<lb />
          order for publication, and return them<lb />
          as soon as possible, that that part of<lb /> 
          the volume may be in the press, which<lb />
          you are completing your part. This<lb />
          will expedite the publication of the book,<lb />
          which ought to be issued so soon as<lb />
          it can be without hurrying you.<lb />
        </p>
          
        <p rendition="#indent">
          Then again, so soon as you have determined<lb />
          upon the illustrations, it would<lb />
          be well to have them in the hands of<lb />
          the engraver, that he may have time<lb />
          enough to do his work well.<lb />

          My wife has been very unwell for<lb /> 
          more than a week with fever - She is<lb />
          getting better - still she is very weak<lb />
          and requires much attention. If there<lb />
          for uncle Peter and his wife come to Syracuse<lb />
          any time we think the ensuing<lb />
          fortnight or three weeks - it is my wish<lb />
          that they should so <unclear>join us</unclear> with some other<lb />
          oue of their friends. If my wife were<lb />
