          <salute>Dear <persName ref="wileyea">Edward</persName></salute>
        </opener>
        <p>
          	Your letter of yesterday’s<lb/> date came to hand this morning<lb/> with the handsome order for another<lb/> box of books (30 pan. + 15 do.) By this time<lb/> the Box is at the Depot and will soon<lb/> been on its way to <choice><sic>Pittsburg</sic><corr>Pittsburgh</corr></choice>.
        </p>
        <p>
	        I am glad to know that your<lb/> efforts are bringing you continued success<lb/> and am quite sanguine that this<lb/> summer’s labors are going to yield you<lb/> well nigh fifteen hundred dollars. Clear<lb/> gain, at least I have been so predicting<lb/> about the matter.
        </p>
        <p>
	        I am happy to say that I<lb/> have a few other young men who<lb/> are doing very nicely. One in <placeName><unclear resp="jd"/><lb/> N.C.</placeName> and another in <placeName>Delaware</placeName>, and<lb/> another in <lb/> <placeName>N.J.</placeName> and still another in <placeName>Buffalo N.Y.</placeName> I have in all at least<lb/> thirty (30) agents in the field and they are<lb/> still coming along daily.
        </p>
        <p>
	        With regards to Jones at <placeName><unclear resp="jd"/><lb/> City</placeName>, if he proves good <unclear resp="jd"/><lb/> I think I would like to appoint him.<lb/> I wrote him and <choice><sic>layed</sic><corr>laid</corr></choice> down the law to him<lb/> 
        <pb n="2"/>
        <fw type="pageNum" place="top-left">2</fw>
            pretty plainly, so that he might understand<lb/> me, <unclear resp="jd"/> if his answer<lb/> comes back all right. I think I shall<lb/> give him an agency.
        </p>
        <p>
	        I have put in your box 3 books<lb/> marked ‘Editor’s Copy”. Now if you<lb/> will try and deliver them in person I<lb/> doubt not but you will derive some<lb/> benefit therefrom at any rate you will<lb/> get good notices.
        </p>
        <p>
	        I put you in a number<lb/> of circulars. If I do not send enough<lb/> let me know it.
        </p>
        <p>
	        Willie is about the same.<lb/> He does some old fashion coughs<lb/> and no mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
	        Coal is dull, as I expected<lb/> it would be just now. <unclear resp="jd"/><lb/> however we put in an order of <unclear reason="faded" cert="low" resp="jd">12</unclear><lb/> tons for Miss Morris on <unclear reason="faded" resp="jd"/><lb/> and I want to put <unclear reason="faded" resp="jd"/> <lb/> <unclear resp="jd"/> as soon as foreseeable <unclear reason="faded" resp="jd"/><lb/> week so that I may do it when<lb/> homes are on hand. I failed to get <unclear reason="faded" resp="jd"/><lb/> as yet. And as to selling<lb/> that cannot be accomplished<lb/> 
        <pb n="3"/>
        <fw type="pageNum" place="top-left">3</fw>
            therefore get out as many orders as I<lb/> can and then let one of the horses go to<lb/> the country for 2 weeks and afterwards<lb/> bring him home and let the other go.
        </p>
        <p>
	        Never was I more sanguine<lb/> than now that I shall succeed in<lb/> selling fifty thousand copies of my books.<lb/> <unclear resp="jd"/> Reading R.R. does not<lb/> trouble me. It is however giving trouble<lb/> to some others.
