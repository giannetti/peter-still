        </opener>
        <p>
          	Your letter of yesterday’s<lb/> date came to hand this morning<lb/> with the handsome order for another<lb/> box of books (30 <unclear>Pa</unclear> &amp; 15 do.) By this time<lb/> the Box is at the Depot and will soon<lb/> <sic>been</sic> on its way to <choice><sic>Pittsburg</sic><corr>Pittsburgh</corr></choice>.
        </p>
        <p>
	        I am glad to know that your<lb/> efforts are bringing you continued success<lb/> and am quite sanguine that this<lb/> summer’s labors are going to yield you<lb/> well nigh fifteen hundred dollars. Clear<lb/> gain, at least I have been so predicting<lb/> about the matter.
        </p>
        <p>
	        I am happy to say that I<lb/> have a few other young men who<lb/> are doing very nicely. One in <placeName><unclear resp="#jd">New bern</unclear><lb/> N.C.</placeName> and another in <placeName>Delaware</placeName>, and<lb/> another in <lb/> <placeName>N.J.</placeName> and still another in <placeName>Buffalo N.Y.</placeName> I have in all at least<lb/> thirty (30) agents in the field and they are<lb/> still coming along daily.
        </p>
        <p>
          With regard to Jones at <placeName><unclear resp="#jd">Monongahela</unclear><lb/> City</placeName>, if he gives good references<lb/> I think I would like to appoint him.<lb/> I wrote him and <choice><sic>layed</sic><corr>laid</corr></choice> down the law to him<lb/> 
        <pb n="2"/>
        <fw type="pageNum" place="top-left">2</fw>
            pretty plainly, so that he might understand<lb/> me, hence if his answer<lb/> comes back all right I think I shall<lb/> give him an agency.
        </p>
        <p>
	        I have put in your box 3 books<lb/> marked "Editor’s Copy”. Now if you<lb/> will try and deliver them in person I<lb/> doubt not but you will derive some<lb/> benefit therefrom at any rate you will<lb/> get good notices.
        </p>
        <p>
	        I put you in a number<lb/> of circulars. If I do not send enough<lb/> let me know it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <persName ref="#stillwiw" cert="medium" resp="#fg">Willie</persName> is about the same.<lb/> He does some old fashion <unclear>coughs</unclear><lb/> and no mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
	        Coal is dull, as I expected<lb/> it would be just now. <unclear resp="#jd"/><lb/> however we put in an order of <unclear reason="faded" cert="low" resp="#jd">12</unclear><lb/> tons for Miss Morris on <unclear reason="faded" resp="#jd">Spruce St</unclear><lb/> and I want to put <unclear reason="faded" resp="#jd"/> <lb/> <unclear resp="#jd"/> as soon as possible <unclear reason="faded" resp="#jd">next</unclear><lb/> week so that I may do it when<lb/> <unclear>horses</unclear> are on hand. I failed to get <unclear reason="faded" resp="#jd"/><lb/> as yet. And as to selling<lb/> that cannot be accomplished<lb/> 
        <pb n="3"/>
        <fw type="pageNum" place="top-left">3</fw>
            therefore get out as many orders as I<lb/> can and then let one of the horses go to<lb/> the country for 2 weeks and afterwards<lb/> bring him home and let the other go.
        </p>
        <p>
	        Never was I more sanguine<lb/> than now that I shall succeed in<lb/> selling fifty thousand copies of my books.<lb/> <unclear resp="#jd">Hence</unclear> Reading R.R. does not<lb/> trouble me. It is however giving trouble<lb/> to some others.
        </p>

          <salute>Yours affectionately</salute>

        You must have waked up matters<lb/> in <choice><sic>Pittsburg</sic><corr>Pittsburgh</corr></choice>.
