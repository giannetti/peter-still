            <p style="text-align: right;">Camillus,</p>
            <p style="text-align: right;">Apr. 24th 1854</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Uncle Peter</p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Your letter of the 20th
               has just come - I am very glad to hear from you but deeply grieved at the news
               of your disappointment. I have been dreading that very answer for several
               months, for slaves have been so high as to furnish a base man just the excuse he
               would like. "Wait on the Lord," is now your duty. Trust in Him, who is able to
               destroy the counsels of the wicked. O how I wish I could help you! But I can
               only commend you to the tender mercies of the Heavenly Father in whose sight the
               poor and humble are never disregarded. May he have compassion on you and grant
               you that blessed boon - the society of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your own family</span>. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;"> You will be surprised when I tell you that sister Julia is married. Her husband Mr
               LeGrand Marvin of Buffalo is a very
               excellent man, though a good many years older than she is. She had never seen
               him when you were here. They met in travelling last fall and were married in
               December. She has made us one short visit since but<br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 2]</small></p><br /> I have seen her in her new home. Mr Marvin
               is a lawyer a man of piety and wealth. Sister Julia visited New
               York and Philadelphia immediately after her marriage, and if the
               weather had not been so bad would have gone to Boston. In that
               case she would have tried to find you, as we supposed you were at that time in
               Boston. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;"> My mother is with me now. She is going west in a few weeks to
               visit sister Julia and several other friends. My little Willie has been quite well the most of the time since you were
               here, but he is now suffering from a violent cold. Mr. Pickard's health is still quite poor. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;"> We have often thought and talked about you during the past
               winter. We hoped you would find it in your way to make us another call. We could
               have got up a meeting and helped you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a little</span> if you could
               have been here in the winter - it was the worst time in the year when you were
               here last summer - I mean the worst to get people's time or attention off <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the</span> from their business. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;"> The Father above has been very kind to you so far dear Uncle
               Peter and he will not forsake you now. He has given you health and energy and
               has disposed the hearts of many kind<br /><p style="text-align: center;"><small>[Page: 3]</small></p><br /> people to aid you and I trust in him for the
               future. I trust that he will so overrule the designs of the wicked oppressors as
               to gladden you poor tried and troubled heart. Pray to him - tell him all your
               desires and all your sorrows, and believe his word, that he will hear the prayer of
               the humble. We cannot see the end, but he has seen it from the beginning. He
               is suffering the wicked to triumph for a little while, but his word declares
               that He will overthrow them forever, and bring all their evil works upon their
               own heads. May H<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a</span>is grace sustain you - his love is warmer and purer than that of wife or
               son or daughter, and no power on earth can separate you from him. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Write to me often and tell me what you are doing and what are
               your plans. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Mr Pickard and Mother send their kindest regards, and Willie
               sends a kiss to Uncle Peter. Willie is a little chatterbox though he does not
               speak very plainly. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Sister Julia would be very glad to hear from you, and would I
               presume have written to you if she had known certainly where you were If you
               should wish to write to her, direct to Mrs. LeGrand Marvin, Buffalo,
               N.Y.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">Your warm &amp; true friend</p>
            <p style="padding-left:13em; text-indent:-2em;">Kate E. R. Pickard</p>
