            <p style="text-align: left;">[Dear] Sir, </p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;"> Your letter has remained unanswered, for so long,
               because I have not been able to have an interview with Mr. McKiernan on the
               subject about which you wrote. I have just seen him. He says he will not
               separate the family of negroes and that the lowest price he will take
               under any circumstances  is $5,000 and
               if that [amount] is placed  in my hands or with any responsible persons for
               him, he will let the negroes go. I would like if Peter could get his wife &amp; family. I think this [amount] a high price,  but it is the lowest I know.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">Very [Respectfully]</p>
            <p style="padding-left:13em; text-indent:-2em;">Lewis B. Thorton</p>
