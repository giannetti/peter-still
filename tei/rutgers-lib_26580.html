            <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Uncle Peter</p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;">
               Your letter of the 12th was most welcome. 
               I had been for some weeks wondering that 
               you did not write to let me know what you were 
               doing, scarcely daring to hope that your great joy was
               so near its accomplishment. I need not tell you how I 
               rejoice in your happiness, indeed I could not if I
               would.
               
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;">
               God has been very kind to you Peter. let us give
               him all the thanks, and let your future life be 
               spent in his loving service. How many thousands
               groan in hopeless bondage that would enjoy their
               liberty as well as you and those you love so dearly!
               We cannot tell <span style="text-decoration: underline;">why</span> He has singled <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> out to
               make you so happy, but I cannot help thinking
               that you will so improve all your advantages as to honor
               Him.
               
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;">
               I am glad you are determined to have all your family
               settled at work this winter. How I would like to see
               them all! Write again when you are all settled.
               I shall want to know where they are. Tell the 
               boys and your girl too that they are young and
               if they try hard they can all get a good education
               They must learn to read and write this winter.
               The long evenings will give them plenty of time. Your<br /><h4>Page: 2</h4><br />daughter will have to learn to do housework and a
               great many other things that the overseer did not
               teach at the quarter.
               
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;">
               What a happy time it was when you and Aunt
               Vina met in Cincinnati. We were talking of you
               that very morning here at home. Sister Julia and
               Mr. Marvin were with us and we were all wishing 
               we could hear whether there was any prospect of
               your getting them this winter.
               
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;">
               Sister Julia has been in poor health ever since
               you saw her, but was much better when she left
               here on the second of this month. She heard
               of your meeting in Cincinnati before we did. an
               account came in their paper and she cut it out
               and sent it to mother.
               
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;">
               I am sorry to think of that poor little baby left
               behind. I do think Mr. McKiernan might have given
               that up. What will you do about it? Do you think
               of trying to get it? If you do that will delay
               the publishing of your narrative.
               
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;">Little Willie has just kissed this paper
               he says he put a kiss on it for Uncle Peter. He remembers 
               you very well and will not be afraid of you when 
               you come again. Mr. Pickard is quite unwell -
               one of his bad turns. he will be better I trust in
               a day or two. The other members of our family are
               well. Give my love to all your family and my best
               wishes for their prosperity. I hope they will be an honor<br /><h4>Page: 3</h4><br />
               to you and themselves. Tell your children 
               I say they ought to be the  best children
               to their father that can be found in the
               whole country. I hope they will prove as
               their father has done, that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">niggers</span> are
               able to take care of themselves.
               
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;">
               Now Good bye - Let me hear from 
               you soon again.
               
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:10em; text-indent:-2em;">I remain your true friend</p>
