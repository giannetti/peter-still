          <salute>Dear Uncle <persName ref="psn:peter_still">Peter</persName></salute>
        </opener>

        <p rendition="#indent"> Why have you not written me<lb/> how you are prospering all this
          long time?<lb/> I have not heard a word from you, except<lb/> that your brother <persName
            ref="psn:william_still">William</persName> said in his letter<lb/> that you and your
          family were well. I would<lb/> like to know where you are and what you are<lb/> doing, and
          how my dear Aunt <persName ref="psn:vina_still">Vina</persName> gets along.<lb/> By the
          way, Uncle Peter, I think from your<lb/> brother's letter that you did not understand<lb/>
          my object in asking the questions which he<lb/> refuses to answer. I had no intention<lb/>
          of publishing any thing that could in any way<lb/> injure your mother's family. I merely
          wished <lb/>
          <hi rendition="#u">to know the facts</hi> that I might have an idea<lb/> in my own mind of
          the circumstances &amp; characteristics<lb/> of your parents <del rend="strikethrough">so
            th</del> and so<lb/> be able to make the description of them more<lb/> interesting than
          I can do with so few facts<lb/> before me. Then I thought that those questions<lb/> might
          elicit from your mother some<lb/> little circumstances, trifling in themselves<lb/>
          <pb n="2" facs="../images/26915_2.png"/> that would so manifest the affection or<lb/>
          energy of your parents as be worthy of a place<lb/> in the "<hi rendition="#u"
            >Narrative</hi>." <del rend="strikethrough">while</del>
          <del rend="strikethrough">they</del> I am sorry your<lb/> friends have so little
          confidence in me as to<lb/> suppose that I would by any means risk<lb/> their safety or
          happiness.<lb/>
        </p>

        <p rendition="#indent"> I came here about two weeks ago, for<lb/> the sake of being free
          from household cares<lb/> so that I might spend all my time in<lb/> writing. I have at
          last succeeded in<lb/> getting a good girl &#8211; <hi rendition="#u">that</hi> you will
          be glad<lb/> to know. My mother is <del rend="strikethrough">ta</del>
          keeping house<lb/> for me in my absence, and I have <persName ref="psn:willie"
            >Willie</persName><lb/> with me here. </p>

        <p rendition="#indent"> Our family are all in usual health &#8211; <lb/> I have just
          received a letter from home<lb/> mailed <date when="1855-06-22" cert="medium">22nd</date>.
          Mr <persName ref="psn:pickard_d_l">Pickard</persName> is not yet well,<lb/> though he is
          rather more comfortable than<lb/> he was when you were at our house. </p>

        <p rendition="#indent"> Grandpa and grandma are very well this<lb/> summer, and tell Aunt
            <persName ref="psn:vina_still">Vina</persName> Mrs. Lyon and<lb/> that dear little Mary
          are doing first rate. </p>

        <p rendition="#indent"> Sister <persName ref="psn:marvin_julia">Julia</persName> is very
          pleasantly situated<lb/> and enjoys house keeping exceedingly. I<lb/> think you would
          enjoy <del rend="strikethrough">seeing</del> visiting her<lb/> now, and I know she would
          like to see you.<lb/> I saw a friend of yours here a day or two<lb/>
          <pb n="3" facs="../images/26915_3.png"/> since, a Mrs. Williams that took a deep<lb/>
          interest in your cause when you visited <placeName key="Buffalo, NY, United States"
            >Buffalo</placeName>.<lb/> She inquired kindly of your welfare and<lb/> that of your
          family, and expressed great anxiety<lb/> on the subject of getting Peter's child.<lb/>
          Have you heard any thing from the little boy?<lb/> Do you intend to try to get it this
          summer?<lb/> I do hope that little fellow may be rescued<lb/> from a life of slavery. </p>

        <p rendition="#indent"> I shall probably remain here three<lb/> or four weeks longer unless
          something<lb/> unexpected should occur to call me home.<lb/> But if you write to me, and I
          hope<lb/> you will, direct to <placeName key="Camillus, NY, United States"
            >Camillus</placeName> &#8211; Mr. Pickard<lb/> is writing to me every two or three days
          &amp;<lb/> he will forward the letter. I want very<lb/> much to hear from you. </p>

        <p rendition="#indent"> Give very much love from me to that<lb/> good Aunt Vina, and tell
          her that not<lb/> one of our family has forgot to love her.<lb/> Take good care of her
          Uncle Peter, and<lb/> also of yourself. I hope your children are<lb/> all thriving. Tell
          them they must remember<lb/> that their friends expect great things<lb/> of them. They are
          anxious that they should<lb/> show the world that freedom is better than<lb/> slavery. </p>
