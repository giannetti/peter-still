                    I received a letter from <persName ref="psn:marvin_julia">sister Julia</persName> on<lb/>
                    <date when="1852-12-31">the last day of December</date>. She expresses much <lb/>
                    interest in your success and <persName ref="psn:hargraves">Dr. Hargraves </persName>will<lb/>
                    do all in his power to induce <persName ref="psn:mckiernan_bernard">Maj. McKiernan</persName><lb/>
                    to let your family go. If no attempt had<lb/>
                    been made to run them off it would not be<lb/>
                    difficult to buy them but <persName>Maj. McKiernan</persName> being <lb/>
                    a hot-headed politician was very much enraged<lb/>
                    by that attempt, and probably meant, when he<lb/>
                    told <persName ref="psn:thornton_lewis">Mr. Thorton</persName> that he would not take less<lb/>
                    than <measure type="currency">$5000</measure> - that he would not not sell them at all. <lb/>
                    I trust however, that he may be induced to <lb/>
                    let them go. The Dr. has enlisted <persName ref="psn:weakley">Judge Weakley's</persName> <lb/>
                    interest in your behalf, and you need not <lb/>
                    fear that any effort on his part will be wanting <lb/>
                    In the mean time you must work yourself <lb/>
                    and be careful to maintain a right spirit. <lb/>
                    Do not cherish bitter or resentful feelings at <lb/>

                    without whose notice not a sparrow falls to the <lb/>
                    ground. These are day of trial - do not let your <lb/>

                    It is very hard and unkind in <persName>Maj. McKiernan</persName> <lb/>
                    to ask such a high price for your family, and even <lb/>
                    to be unwilling to sell them at all, but you must <lb/>
                    not speak harshly of him or even let your thoughts <lb/>
                    dwell too much on that part of the subject. <lb/>
                    It will do you no good - it will make you no friends <lb/>
                    to indulge such feelings but it will injure your <lb/>
                    character. You will not be so well fitted to <lb/>
