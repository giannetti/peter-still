        <p rendition="#indent"> The bearer of this<lb/> is <persName ref="psn:peter_still">Peter
            Still</persName>, a freeman, seeking aid, to obtain<lb/> possession of his <persName
            ref="psn:vina_still">wife</persName> &amp; children, slaves<lb/> in
            <placeName>Alabama</placeName>. He himself was kidnapped<lb/> when six years of age,
          taken from <placeName>N.J.</placeName> to <lb/>
          <placeName>Kentucky</placeName> &amp; there sold as a slave. From Ky.<lb/> he was taken to
          Ala. There, after having worked<lb/> faithfully 44 years, he, by the aid of a <lb/>
          <persName ref="psn:joseph_friedman">Jew</persName>, found means to buy himself. The<lb/>
          hope of once more finding his home &amp;<lb/> friends had ever been most warmly,
          though<lb/> secretly, cherished. By a series of most wonderful<lb/> Providences, he found
          them, his mother<lb/> &amp; many brothers &amp; sisters. He, then returned<lb/> to Ala. on
          a pass from his Jew master (he<lb/> being, in the South, supposed to be a slave)<lb/> told
          his wife &amp; children of his success &amp;<lb/> that he should now work for them.<lb/>
          <pb n="2" facs="../images/26912_2.png"/> He went again to N.J. &amp; there for more<lb/>
          than a year worked sometimes at the rate of <lb/>
          <measure type="currency">$10</measure> <abbr>pr.</abbr> month, some of the time at <measure
            type="currency">$15</measure> with<lb/> the hope of earning enough to free his
          family.<lb/> Some friends advised him to try to raise it<lb/> by contributions. (The sum
          demanded is <measure type="currency">$5000</measure>)<lb/> He did try &amp; has succeeded
          in raising the<lb/> entire sum. Now he needs <measure type="currency">$200</measure> to
          bear their<lb/> expenses here.<lb/>
        </p>

        <p> During my residence in the South I knew him<lb/> well &amp; always knew him as honest,
          faithful &amp;<lb/> industrious. I know him to be strictly truthful<lb/> one upon whose
          word you may rely implicitly.<lb/> You will, if you have time, be much interested<lb/> in
          his simple story.<lb/>
        </p>

        <p> You will see from a letter in his possession<lb/> the necessity that seems to exist for
          his<lb/> remaining as quiet as possible, this will<lb/> account to you for his going so
          with letters<lb/> of introduction to different individuals, rather<lb/> than appearing in
          public.<lb/>
        </p>

        <p> I know, my dear pastor, that your heart is ever<lb/>
          <pb n="3" facs="../images/26912_3.png"/> touched with the sorrows of the afflicted<lb/>
          &amp; of the lowly, that your ear is ever open to a<lb/> tale of suffering. For this
          reason I commend<lb/> him to you, hoping that you may be able<lb/> to assist him.<lb/>
        </p>

        <p> From a recent accident, the dislocation of my<lb/> ankle, I am closely confined at
          present but<lb/> were it not so, my acquaintance in <placeName>Buffalo</placeName><lb/> is
          too limited to enable me to do him all<lb/> the good I would.<lb/>
        </p>
