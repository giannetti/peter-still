      		Since my return, I have inquired<lb />
      		carefully into the sale of the <choice><corr>copyright</corr><sic>copy right</sic></choice><lb />
      		and stereotype plates of your books, and<lb />
      		believe I can now explain the matter, so as<lb />
      		to satisfy you, that no intended wrong<lb />
      		was done you, however unfortunate<lb />
      		for you the sale of those things may have<lb />
      		proved to you.<lb />
        </p>
        
        <p rendition="#indent">
      		You understand, I presume, that the<lb />
      		<choice><corr>copyright</corr><sic>copy right</sic></choice> and the stereotype plates belonged<lb />
      		at first to the publisher._ Where he failed<lb />
      		in business, and it became necessary that<lb />
      		those things should be sold, with the rest of<lb />
      		his effects, to somebody._ I am told they<lb />
      		were offered first to you_ and offered<lb />
      		to you at a price much less than they<lb />
      		cost. <persName>Mr Hamilton</persName> assures me, they were<lb />
      		sold to <persName>Mr Parish</persName> as your friend, and<lb />
      		that it was supposed you were to be<lb />
      		benefitted by the sale of them to him_<lb />
      		and would sooner or later become the<lb />
      		owner of them.<lb />
        </p>
        
        <p rendition="#indent">
      		I hear that Mr Parish first offered<lb />
      		them to you for what they cost him, i.e.<lb />
      		$250._ and that where he found you<lb />
          
          <pb n="2" facs="../images/26923_2.png" />
      		
          indisposed or unable to take them<lb />
      		off his hands_ that, he then offered<lb />
      		to let you have an edition of your<lb />
      		book printed from the plates, before<lb />
      		he should sell them to <choice><corr>anybody</corr><sic>any body</sic></choice><lb />
      		else.<lb />
        </p>

        <p rendition="#indent">
      		Now if this statement is true, you<lb />
      		certainly have no reason to complain<lb />
      		of the publisher or of Mr Parish_<lb />
      		though you might complain of your<lb />
      		hard fate in being unable to pay for<lb /> 
      		the copy right and the plates._<lb />
        </p>
        
        <p rendition="#indent">
      		I wrote to <persName ref="psn:pickard_kate">Mrs Pickard</persName> from <placeName>Brooklyn</placeName>,<lb />
      		the day after I saw you_ but<lb />
      		as I have not heard from her, I fear<lb />
      		she did not receive my letter. So<lb />
      		I wrote to her again yesterday_ and<lb /> 
      		when I hear from her_ if she gives<lb />
      		me any different account of the<lb />
      		matter, I will write to you again.<lb />
      		But, from all I can learn from<lb />
      		others, she has certainly done you no<lb />
      		wrong. You have no reason whatever<lb />
      		to blame her for the sale of the copy<lb />
      		right and the plates - for it was<lb />
      		a loss to herself to have them sold<lb />
      		to <choice><corr>anybody</corr><sic>any body</sic></choice> but yourself- or to<lb />
      		some friend of yours for your benefit.<lb />

        <pb n="3" facs="../images/26923_3.png" />

      		I have heard that after consulting, you<lb />
      		Mr Parish did sell the <choice><corr>copyright</corr><sic>copy right</sic></choice> and<lb />
      		the stereotype plates of your book to a<lb />
      		<persName>Mr Jones</persName> of <placeName>London</placeName>. But even there<lb />
      		they are not beyond your reach.<lb />
      		Printing is done, I believe, more cheaply<lb />
      		in London than in <placeName>New York</placeName>, so<lb /> 
      		that, whenever you are ready to<lb />
      		buy them, I presume you can have<lb />
      		an edition of three or five hundred<lb />
      		copies printed for you in London<lb />
      		and delivered to you in <placeName>Burlington</placeName><lb />
      		for about the same price you<lb />
      		would have to pay for them, if<lb />
      		they should be printed for you in<lb /> 
      		New York._ If you wish, I will<lb />
      		write to Mr Jones and as certain how<lb />
      		much he will charge you for them.<lb />
      	</p>

        <!-- not quite sure if this is its own paragraph -->
        <p rendition="#indent">
          But, Uncle Peter, I am quite as much<lb />
      		worried about your difficulty with<lb />
      		<persName>Mr Smith</persName> respecting the price of your<lb />
      		house and land. I hope it will soon<lb />
      		be settled_ and without a lawsuit.<lb />
      		Suppose you and Mr Smith agree<lb />
      		upon three good men, to whom you<lb />
      		will refer the whole matter, and<lb />
      		let them decide how the difficulty<lb />
      		shall be settled.<lb />
        </p>

        <pb n="4" facs="../images/26923_4.png" />

        <p>
      		Let those three men come together<lb />
      		at some convenient time and place<lb />
      		then let Mr Smith state the facts of<lb />
      		the case as he believes to be true_<lb />
      		then you make your statement of<lb /> 
      		the facts as you understand them_<lb />
      		and each of you bring forward<lb />
      		whatever <unclear>writer</unclear> or other evidence<lb />
      		you may have to suppose your<lb />
      		several statements_ and let the<lb />
      		three references decide <choice><corr>between</corr><sic>be tween</sic> you.<lb />
      		Then_ whatever may be their decision,<lb />
      		do you and Mr Smith abide by<lb />
      		it. This is the best way to settle._<lb />
      		I hope soon to hear you have done<lb /> 
      		so._ Give my very kind regards<lb />
      		to your wife and son_ and<lb />
      		believe me<lb />
