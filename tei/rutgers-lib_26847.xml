          Your letter of the <date when="1854-03-20" cert="medium">20th</date> has just<lb />
          come - I am very glad to hear from you but<lb />
          deeply grieved at the news of your disappointment.<lb />
          I have been dreading that very answer for<lb />
          several months, for slaves have been so high<lb />
          as to furnish a base man just the excuse<lb />
          he would like. "Wait on the Lord," is<lb />
          now your duty - Trust in Him, who is able to<lb />
          destroy the counsels of the wicked. O how I<lb />
          wish I could help you! But I can only<lb />
          commend you to the tender mercies of the<lb />
          Heavenly Father in whose sight the poor and<lb />
          humble are never disregarded. May he have<lb />
          compassion on you and grant you that blessed<lb />

          You will be surprised when I tell you<lb />
          that <persName ref="psn:marvin_julia">sister Julia</persName> is married. Her husband<lb />
          Mr LeGrand Marvin of <placeName>Buffalo</placeName> is a very<lb />
          excellent man, though a good many years<lb />
          older than she is. She had never seen him<lb />
          when you were here - They met in travelling<lb />
          last fall and were married in <date when="1853-12">December</date>.<lb />
          She has made us one short visit since but<lb />
          <pb n="2" facs="../images/26847_2.png" />
          I have seen her in her new home. Mr<lb />
          Marvin is a lawyer a man of piety and<lb />
          wealth. Sister Julia visited <placeName>New York</placeName> and<lb />
          <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> immediately after her marriage,<lb />
          and if the weather had not been so bad<lb />
          would have gone to <placeName>Boston</placeName>. In that case<lb />
          she would have tried to find you, as we<lb />
          supposed you were at that time in Boston.

          My mother is with me now. She is going<lb />

          been quite well the most of the time since<lb />
          you were here, but he is now suffering from<lb />

          We have after thought and talked about<lb />

          We could have got up a meeting and helped<lb />
          you <hi rendition="#u">a</hi> <hi rendition="#u">little</hi> if you could have been here in<lb />
          the winter - it was the worst time in the<lb />

          people to aid you and I trust in him<lb />
          for the future. I trust that he will so<lb />
          overrule the designs of the wicked oppressors<lb />
          as to gladden you poor tried and troubled<lb />
          heart. Pray to him - tell him all your<lb />
          desires and all your sorrows, and believe his<lb />
          word, that he will hear the prayer of the<lb />
          humble. We cannot see the end, but he<lb />
          has seen it from the beginning. He is<lb />
          suffering the wicked to triumph for a<lb />
          little while, but his word declares that<lb />
          He will overthrow them forever, and bring<lb />
