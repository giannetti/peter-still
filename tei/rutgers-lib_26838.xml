          The bearer of this is <persName ref="psn:peter_still">Peter Still</persName>.<lb />
          His story is a remarkable one, but well<lb />
          authenticated. I have examined all his<lb />
          papers, and have received letters testifying<lb />
          to his excellent character from<lb /> 
          persons who knew him in <placeName key="AL, United States">Alabama</placeName>.<lb />
        </p>

        <p rendition="#indent">
          He was stolen from the banks of<lb />
          the <placeName key="Delaware River">Delaware River</placeName>, when a child of<lb />
          five or six years of age; and sold<lb /> 
          into slavery in <placeName key="KY, United States">Kentucky</placeName>. There he<lb /> 
          lived thirteen years; and was then<lb />
          sold and carried to Alabama and<lb />
          kept in slavery thirty one years longer.<lb />
          By extraordinary exertion and the<lb />
          greatest carefulness, he succeeded in<lb />
          accumulating <measure type="currency" quantity="500">five hundred dollars</measure>,<lb />
          which he paid to his master, and was set<lb />
          free.<lb />
        </p>

        <p rendition="#indent">
          He came to the North, and by a most<lb /> 
          singular providence, he found brothers<lb /> 
          and sisters living in <placeName key="Philadelphia, PA, United States">Philadelphia</placeName>, and<lb />
          his aged mother still alive in <placeName key="NJ, United States">New Jersey</placeName>,<lb />
          where he had left her when he was<lb /> 
          stolen.<lb /> 
        </p>

        <p rendition="#indent">
          Having recovered his own liberty, he is<lb /> 
          now eager to procure the freedom of his<lb />

          <persName ref="psn:vina_still">wife</persName> and children, two sons and a daughter.<lb />
          It is hoped that their liberation may<lb />
          be obtained for <measure type="currency" quantity="3500">$3,500</measure>. This may seem to<lb />
          many a large sum; but what is it in comparison<lb /> 
          with the gift of liberty to four<lb />
          human beings? If every one who has heard<lb /> 
          or may hear Peter Still's story, will only<lb /> 
          give him what he or she can well afford,<lb />
          the sum will soon be raised.<lb />

        <p rendition="#indent">
          About <measure type="currency" quantity="1500">fifteen hundred dollars</measure> have<lb />
