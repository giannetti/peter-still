               Dear Sir
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:4em;">
               I wrote to you 27<sup>th</sup><span style="font-style: italic;">ult<sup>o</sup>[?]</span>
               in reply to yours of 17<sup>th</sup>. Mr. McKeirnan did not return
               home [until] a few days ago, and I had not an [opportunity]
               of seeing him until [today], the negroes he says are
               among the most Valuable in the Country, and he will
               not dispose of them under Six thousand Dols. he says
               he can any day sell the two boys for three thousand Dols
               and as their running away Cost him over one thousand
               Dol. to get them back he will make their <span style="font-style: italic;">friend[?]</span> pay for
               that. I [tried] to get him to put them at a lower figure
               but could not get him to agree to it, he will not <span style="font-style: italic;">agree[?]</span>
               to deliver them at [Cincinnati] but will deliver them
               here, to myself or any one you may appoint to receive them
               and pay him the above amount we know regular <span style="font-style: italic;">[?]</span>
               running between here and Louisville by which they <span style="font-style: italic;">could[?]</span>
               get round to [Cincinnati]. <span style="font-style: italic;">Should[?]</span> the friends of these <span style="font-style: italic;">negroes[?]</span>
               conclude to purchase them at this price I shall with pleasure
               advance that amount and draw on you should you <span style="font-style: italic;">ask[?]</span>
               me to do so.
