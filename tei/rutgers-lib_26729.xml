        <p rendition="#indent">
          You can scarcely imagine my delight <lb/>
          at greeting once more my good friend <persName ref="psn:peter_still">Peter</persName><lb/>
          and under circumstances so unlike those which <lb/>
          attended my first acquaintance with him.</p>
        <p rendition="#indent">
          When I first entered the <name type="org">Tuscumbia <abbr>Fem.</abbr><lb/>
            Seminary</name> as a teacher – <date when="1847-01-15">Jan. 15 1847</date> – there <lb/>
          was Peter –  <hi rendition="#u">a slave</hi>! Morning, noon, and <lb/>
          night found him there. For a year I met <lb/>
          him every day, and every day saw more cause <lb/>
          to admire his character. <lb/>
        </p>
        <p rendition="#indent">
          I did not then know that he panted for freedom, <lb/>
          the fact that he was saving every penny to <lb/>
          "buy himself" was a secret. I knew that he <lb/>
          worked hard, that he bought no fine clothes <lb/>
          though his <del/> garments were always scrupulously <lb/>
          clean. I knew at one time of his having <lb/>
          <measure type="currency">$10</measure> in <measure type="currency">5 cent pieces</measure> changed for gold, and <lb/>
          that all these little earnings were carefully <lb/>
          hoarded. but if I had guessed the object of his <lb/>
          industry and economy, I should have deemed <lb/>
          it <del>wisest</del> most prudent to ask no questions <lb/>
          and to make no remarks. <lb/>
        </p>
        <p rendition="#indent">
          Peter at that time belonged to the <name type="place">Gist <lb/>
            estate</name>, to an <persName ref="psn:levi_gist" cert="medium">heir</persName> of which <persName>Mrs. John Hogun</persName> <lb/>
        
        <pb n="2" facs="../images/26729_2.png" /> 
          he was apportioned. The Gist and Hogun <lb/>
          families lived on plantations in the neighborhood <lb/>
          of <placeName>Tuscumbia</placeName>, and Peter had been for several <lb/>
          years hired out in town. He could do all <lb/>
          kinds of work – in the house, the stable, or the <lb/>
          field – and his capability and integrity were so <lb/>
          well known to the citizens generally that he was <lb/>
          trusted everywhere.
        </p>
        <p rendition="#indent">
          I left the <name type="org">Tuscumbia Seminary</name> at the <lb/>
          end of a year, but remained in the vicinity <lb/>
          until <date when="1850-04-01">April 1850</date>. During this time I visited <lb/>
          <placeName>Tuscumbia</placeName> frequently, and always met Peter <lb/>
          there. <name type="person">Mr. Sloan</name> (formerly of <placeName>Syracuse</placeName> you <lb/> 
          will recollect) could hardly do without him <lb/>
          at the school rooms. He was so punctual, and <lb/>
          so orderly, so kind and respectful to the pupils, <lb/>
          that no one could quite fill his place. 
        </p>
        <p rendition="#indent">
          Besides his work at the Seminary, he <lb/>
          waited on <persName ref="psn:joseph_friedman">Mr. Friedman</persName> by whom he was hired, <lb/>
          blacked his boots, swept his room, &amp;c. &amp;c. waited <lb/>
          on the table at the hotel to pay his board, <lb/>
          and did all sorts of odd jobs for any one in <lb/>
          town who happened to need his services. He <lb/>
          had always plenty to do, and always did it well.
        </p>
        <p rendition="#indent"> 
          And now he is free! After forty <lb/>
          years of toil, he at length possesses a deed of himself <lb/>
          – <hi rendition="#u">conferring the right to be a man</hi> instead of a <lb/>
          chattel. And he has found his mother!
        </p>
          <pb n="3" facs="../images/26729_3.png" />
        <p rendition="#indent">
          How eloquent is his simple story! Who can <lb/>
          listen to it with unmoistened eyes?
        </p>
        <p rendition="#indent">
          But his poor <persName ref="psn:vina_still">wife</persName> and their three children are <lb/>
          still slaves and the only way that seems open for <lb/>
          their exit from the land of bondage is through <lb/>
          the gate of money.
        </p>
        <p rendition="#indent">
         Some conscientious persons object to <hi rendition="#u">paying</hi> the <lb/>
         man-stealer for his prey, but poor Peter's <lb/>
         anxious heart cannot by such scruples be <lb/>
         quieted. He longs for the presence of those <lb/>
         so dear to him – and they – how do their hearts <lb/>
         yearn for the society of husband and father! <lb/>
         When at night they stretch themselves upon their <lb/>
         rude pallets in their lowly cabin, and when the <lb/>
         dawn of morning calls them to their weary <lb/>
         tasks, do they not pray for deliverance? <lb/>
         O let us save them if we can! The giver shall <lb/>
         be blessed, and <persName ref="psn:mckiernan_bernard">Maj. McKiernan</persName>, the owner of <lb/>
         their bodies will be little benefited, even though <lb/> 
         he should receive the whole of his exhorbitant <lb/>
         demand.
       </p>
        <p rendition="#indent">
          I think however that if some generous <lb/>
          neighbor of <persName>Maj. McKiernan</persName> can be induced to <lb/>
          lend his aid, that price may be abated. They <lb/>
          could not, I should think be valued, <hi rendition="#u"> according<lb/>
            to market prices</hi>, higher than <measure type="currency">$3000</measure>. It <lb/>
          would at least, be well to make the effort.<lb/>
          I have a friend there, an honest and influential
          <pb n="4" facs="../images/26729_4.png" />
          man, who may I think be persuaded <lb/>
          to exert himself in his behalf I will try.
        </p>
        <p rendition="#indent">
          Peter's cause commends itself to every <lb/>
          human heart – and <unclear>O</unclear> if human hearts <lb/>
          will but overcome the dictates of cold selfishness, <lb/>
          how soon will his anxious suspense <lb/>
          be ended! May the Friend of the Poor speedily <lb/>
          reward his patience by the realization of his <lb/>
          fondest hopes!
        </p>
        <p rendition="#indent">
          I hope Sir, to see you when I go to <lb/>
          <placeName>Syracuse</placeName>, which will probably be before <lb/>
          many days, and to learn of the success of <lb/>
          your efforts. We will do all we can for him <lb/>
