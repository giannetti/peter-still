          It is a long time since I<lb />
          wrote you last - have you thought you were<lb />
          forgotten, or that I had ceased to feel any<lb />
          interest in your welfare? If so, you were<lb />
          greatly mistaken - I have thought of you<lb />
          very often, + have sometimes heard from you<lb />
          through Mr. Hamilton, and once in the<lb />
          winter <persName ref="psn:samuel_may">Mr. May</persName> sent me a letter which<lb />
          he had received from you. He wished me<lb />
          to write you then, but I was not able to<lb />
          do so.<lb />
        </p>
        
        <p rendition="#indent">
          I do not know whether you have heard anything<lb />
          from us since I wrote you last - Our<lb />
          family has greatly changed since then. Mother<lb />
          Pickard died at Mr Lyon's on the 9th of<lb />
          last December. She was injured by falling<lb />
          on the step as she was going out the door,<lb />
          and died in a few hours. Almost at the<lb />
          moment she fell, my baby was born - a little<lb />

          <pb n="2" facs="../images/26922_2.png" />
          
          daughter. At the same time a Miss Pickard<lb />
          - a cousin of ours was here very ill - so as to<lb />
          be unable to rise alone. It was a<lb /> 
          time of great trouble and you will hardly<lb />
          wonder that during the past winter our<lb />
          own cares and sorrows have so absorbed<lb />
          our attention that we have had little<lb />
          time or spirits to write letters. I was<lb />
          confined to my room all winter - did not<lb />
          go out of the house till the very last of<lb />
          March.<lb />

        <p rendition="#indent">
          We are all now in usual health - Grandpa<lb />
          has had a severe sickness this Spring -<lb />
          two weeks ago we feared he would never<lb />
          recover, but he is now able to ride about.<lb />
          He has failed very much since you were<lb />
          here + particularly since Grandma's death.<lb />
        </p>

        <p rendition="#indent">
          My mother is in <placeName>Buffalo</placeName> with sister<lb />

          <choice><corr>bilious</corr><sic>billious</sic></choice> attack. I am sorry to say her<lb />
          family has received no such addition as<lb />

          Mr Lyon's family are very well. Miss<lb />

          Jennie is at home, and the two little girls<lb />
          are growing finely. The little one that was<lb />
          a baby when you were here is a beauty +<lb />
          one of the smartest children you ever saw.<lb />

          the prettiest, dearest, sweetest baby alive<lb />
          she must come + look at my little Jane<lb />

        <p rendition="#indent">
          And so your dear old <persName ref="psn:charity_still">mother</persName> has<lb />
          gone to her reward! You should not mourn<lb />
          for her, Uncle Peter, for her sorrows are<lb />
          all past. She lived to suffer much, but<lb />
          her last days were <unclear>cheered</unclear> by a great joy.<lb />
          Surely her end was peace, and her memory<lb />
          is blessed. She is no doubt now rejoicing<lb />
          in the presence of the Blessed One, and<lb /> 
          holding sweet intercourse with the freed<lb />
          spirit of that dear brother whose form<lb />
          moulders in a land of slaves.<lb />

          I am glad your children are all doing well.<lb />
          How do you get along in paying for your<lb />
          place? I am glad you have made a good<lb />
          beginning in selling your books. Last year<lb />
          there was so much political excitement,<lb />

          <pb n="3" facs="../images/26922_3.png" />

          that no doubt, the sales were slower than<lb />
          they would otherwise have been. This year<lb />
          I think you will do still better, and on<lb />
          <hi rendition="#u">all</hi> <hi rendition="#u">you</hi> <hi rendition="#u">sell</hi> you get two profits - your<lb />
          share as proprietor + the agents percentage<lb />
          besides. I hope you will be able to push<lb />
          it and get off a good number of the books<lb />
          during the year. <hi rendition="#u">You</hi> can do more than<lb />
          any one else if you do your best. I do not<lb />
          care so much about the small profit that<lb />
          I should receive as I do about your doing<lb />
          well. Keep up your courage Uncle Peter<lb />
          - you have proved yourself able to accomplish<lb />
          great things. Try - and let me<lb />
          hear from you often.<lb />

          I have heard no news from <placeName>Alabama</placeName><lb />
