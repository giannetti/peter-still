            <p rendition="#indent"> An extraordinary press of business and sickness in my family
               has prevented an earlier reply to thy letter of the <date when="1854-09-09">9<hi
                     rend="superscript">th</hi></date> I am rejoiced to learn that <persName
                  ref="psn:peter_still">Peter</persName> has been so successful in making
               collections. and he may rest assured that I will not divulge the facts. for I am
               aware that it is all important it should be kept a profound secret. I think that when
               Peter understands the position in which the affair now is that he will recall his
               instructions to me to call on Birney &amp; Goodrich. Soon after Peter requested me to
               act for him I became satisfied after as thorough investigation as the circumstances
               would admit of that the negotiation for the purchase of his family woud never be
               carried to a successful termination by correspondence and therefore despatched a
               gentleman (in whom I have full confidence) to <placeName>Florence Ala</placeName>
               with <pb n="2"/> instructions if he could get possession of the <persName
                  ref="psn:vina_still">wife</persName> and children and carry them to
                  <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName>. I instructed him to place himself under the
               advice and direction of <persName ref="psn:john_simpson">John Simpson</persName> an
               old personal friend and wealthy merchant to whom I wrote giving him all the facts and
               asking his personal interest and attention. Simpson recollected Peter and promised to
               give all the aid in his power; but he said the owner had been so frequently
               approached by letter and otherwise that it would be very unwise for my agent to go to
               him; that his feeling towards Peter was very bitter and that the family could not now
               be bought on any terms. He said further that if we would place the affair in his
               hands he would embrace the earliest opportunity of carrying out our views. </p>
            <p rendition="#indent"> Thou will readily perceive that in this position of affairs it would be very unwise
               again to call on Birney &amp; Goodrich who are not lawyers but are proprietors of
               what is known here as a Commercial Agency. The amount named to Simpson as the sum
               Peter can pay for his family is <measure type="currency">$3500.</measure> and he is
               authorized to draw on me at sight for that amount wherever he can make
               the purchase. I think it would be unwise to let Simpson know that. Peter can <del
                  rend="strikethrough"><unclear>raise</unclear></del> command <pb n="3"/> a larger
               sum and I would <subst>
                  <del rend="strikethrough">ardently</del>
                  <add place="above">earnestly</add>
               </subst> advise the latter not to move in the matter in any way until he again hears
               from me. </p>
